9,"A New York teen who lost everything in Hurricane Sandy has been accepted to seven Ivy League schools. Daria Rose, 18, immersed herself in her studies after she and her family lost everything -- including their home -- when the superstorm hit in October 2012. And after a difficult high school experience, the 18-year-old has a bright future ahead of her. The Hempstead teen has been accepted into all seven of the Ivy League schools she applied to, ABC news reports. Scroll down for video . Acceptance: New York teen Daria Rose (photographed) lost everything in Hurricane Sandy and was recently accepted to seven Ivy League schools . Dreams: The frequent moves Rose and her family underwent after the superstorm made finishing school work difficult for Rose, but she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school . 'I was like, oh my God, I just got into Harvard,' Rose told ABC 7. 'Then I checked Princeton, and I was like, oh my God I, just got into Princeton. And I checked Brown, I got in. It just kept going and going.' Rose did not apply to Columbia, according to ABC. Rose and her family lived in several hotels as well as her grandmother's house after being forced to evacuate their home in Baldwin, which was destroyed, ABC News reports. After more than a year, the family moved into a new home in Baldwin. Although the frequent moves made finishing school work difficult, Rose said, she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school. 'I was living in these small spaces but in my head I was able to escape,' Rose said 'find myself in a literary world.' Rose wrote about her Hurricane Sandy experience in a college application essay in which she talked about the storm and how reading helped her cope. Secure: A college essay about her experience helped Rose to secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown . Blessing: Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks (left), said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because the teen had something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices . The essay helped the Sacred Heart Academy student secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown. 'After moving so much and meeting so many different people, I learned I can adapt and adjust to all these different situations and people,' Rose told ABC 7. Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks, said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because it provided the teen with something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices. 'It's easy to say 'I'm just going to lay here in a ball and cry and wallow in my own self pity,'' Brooks said. 'I'd make sure she'd get up and put one foot in front of the other.' Destroyed: Rose and her family lived in several hotels as well as her grandmother's house after being forced to evacuate their home in Baldwin (photographed), which was destroyed . New Home: After more than a year, the family moved into a new home in Baldwin (photographed is wreckage of Rose's home following the storm) While Rose said she had always leaned toward Yale, in her junior year of high school, she began looking at other options and decided to apply to the seven schools. Rose applied to seven of the eight Ivy League schools and, on March 31, the schools posted their decisions online, according to ABC. 'They're all such great schools,' Rose said. '[I'll] try to see where I'll fit in the best.' Rose said she plans to study political science and Russian literature. She has until May 1 to decided where she will attend.","New York teen Daria Rose lost everything in Hurricane Sandy and was recently accepted to seven Ivy League schools .

10,"Vladimir Putin honoured the man Scotland Yard believes poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko (pictured) with polonium in London . Vladimir Putin yesterday honoured the man Scotland Yard believes poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko with polonium in London. Andrey Lugovoy, 48, was given a medal for 'services to the motherland' as the UK holds a public inquiry into the 2006 killing of Mr Litvinenko. Putin had blocked the extradition of Lugovoy, a former secret-service operative who is now an MP with the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party. The Russian president also gave the Order of Honour to Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya. The award came as Kadyrov admitted knowing the man who has confessed to killing Putin critic Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. Kadyrov appeared to defend the suspect Zaur Dadayev by calling him a 'true patriot' and a 'deeply religious man'. Opposition politician Ilya Yashin said Putin was sending a signal: 'These are my people, do not touch them.' Kadyrov received his state award for 'work achievements, strenuous social activities and long conscientious service', but it comes amid claims that even some senior Russian officials are worried about the sway held by the Chechen. Lugovoy holds the post of deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's security and anti-corruption committee. He is chief suspect in the murder of former secret agent Mr Litvinenko, who from his death bed accused Putin of ordering his killing. Putin revealed yesterday that he held an all-night conclave of his defence and secret services cardinals ahead of his order last year to restore Crimea to Russia. In a trailer for a new TV documentary, he admitted calling his security chiefs to the Kremlin for a secret meeting to order them to save the life of deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Andrey Lugovoy (pictured), 48, was given a medal for 'services to the motherland' as the UK holds a public inquiry into the 2006 killing of Mr Litvinenko . The Russians allege the West was complicit in the toppling of pro-Moscow Yanukovych so threatening Russia's national security. 'I invited the leaders of our special services and the defence ministry to the Kremlin and set them the task of saving the life of the president of Ukraine, who would simply have been liquidated,' said Putin. 'We finished about seven in the morning. When we were parting, I told all my colleagues, ""We are forced to begin the work to bring Crimea back into Russia"".'","Russia honours the man believed to have poisoned Alexander Litvinenko .

12,"(CNN)Anna Duritskaya, the Ukrainian model who was with opposition politician Boris Nemtsov when he was shot in Moscow, is now the focus of intense interest. A beautiful brunette more than 30 years his junior, she had been his girlfriend for 2½ years. So what is known about her? The 23-year-old had been out for dinner with Nemtsov on Friday night. She had suggested getting a taxi, but Nemtsov didn't want to, preferring to walk, Duritskaya's mother said. As the pair crossed a bridge in central Moscow, the 55-year-old Kremlin critic was gunned down by unknown attackers. His girlfriend was holding his hand and heard what sounded like a clapping sound, her mother, Inna Duritskaya, told CNN. Nemtsov went limp and fell to the ground, fatally shot in the back. Duritskaya is the only known witness to the shooting, which occurred 100 meters (330 feet) from the Kremlin but appears not to have been captured on security cameras. Inna Duritskaya said her daughter called her right after she called police to raise the alarm. ""She was crying and she was saying Boris had been killed and he's lying next to me,"" Inna Duritskaya said. ""She was in such shock she couldn't say anything else. Just, 'Mum, Boris is killed, and he's lying next to me.' "" On Monday, the Russian television station Dozhd published an interview with Anna Duritskaya. She told the interviewer that she did not see who killed Nemtsov, but that when she turned around, she saw a light-colored car driving away. In an interview with CNN, Ilya Yashin, a political ally and friend of Nemtsov's, said that Duritskaya had telephoned him immediately after the shooting and said there were several men in the car containing the shooter. Over the weekend, Russian authorities questioned Duritskaya about what she saw. While in Moscow, the model was staying at the apartment of an Nemtsov aide under constant police guard. But Moscow's Investigative Committee insisted that she was not detained and could have left at any time. ""She said she wanted to give the testimony and took part in investigative activities understanding the importance of it for the investigation,"" a statement released Tuesday said. ""We received no complaints from Anna Duritskaya or her lawyer during her stay in Moscow. Only today, after investigative activities are over she left Russia."" The model left the Russian capital Monday night bound for Kiev, Ukraine, said Yevhen Perebyinis, a spokesman for Ukraine's Foreign Ministry. Inna Duritskaya told CNN that while being questioned, her daughter faced constant psychological pressure from Moscow authorities and that she fears she will be implicated in his death. In a Skype interview with Dozhd, Anna Duritskaya indicated her continued presence in Moscow after the shooting was not from choice -- and seemed to appeal to be allowed to leave. ""Now I have a status of a witness, I gave all evidence possible, I don't understand why I'm still on the territory of Russia. I want to go to my mother who is ill, who is in very difficult psychological condition,"" she said. ""During three days, they have been taking me together with security in police cars to the Investigation Committee and conduct the investigation. They are not explaining when they are going to release me and the reason they are keeping me here."" Perhaps not. According to the Investigative Committee, Duritskaya signed a witness protocol and confidentiality agreement, which is standard procedure in Russia. It states that she will not share information she gave to investigators or any preliminary findings of the investigation, the committee said. ""Leaving Russia, Duritskaya expressed a wish to continue to cooperate with the investigation and to participate in any ongoing investigation if needed,"" it added. Inna Duritskaya said her daughter knew the risks of getting involved with the prominent opposition leader. ""Of course when I heard she was dating him, it was a bit of a shock,"" she said. ""Then when I met him in person, I liked him a lot as a person. He was straightforward, he treated my daughter very well, she was happy. And I couldn't influence it anyway; my daughter did what she wanted to. Of course, I was worried and scared, but I couldn't change it anyway."" Duritskaya's reported return to Kiev means she was unable to attend her partner's memorial service and funeral Tuesday. CNN's Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","Anna Duritskaya, a 23-year-old Ukrainian model, was Boris Nemtsov's girlfriend .

16,"Sally Cox, 39, stopped her son Jed Pearce, 10 (pictured together above), from going on the mosque trip, expressing fears of 'violence and guns' Children as young as eight have been banned by their parents from attending a British mosque as part of a school trip over 'safety' fears, with one mother claiming she 'doesn't want to put her son at risk of being shot'. Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon, as part of an RE trip to learn about different faiths. The schoolchildren, from years three to six, were due to visit the city's cathedral before taking a tour of the mosque and observing a congregational prayer. However, about 10 pupils have now pulled out of next week's school trip after their parents said they  would be exposed to 'violence and guns' and expressed 'grave concerns' about the teaching of Islam. Christine Trevethen, 47, a housewife from Lostwithiel, Cornwall, has stopped her 10-year-old daughter Keira going on the visit. She said: 'We are not the only ones that don't want our kids to go - but a lot of the others haven't been honest enough to do so in the consent form. 'I do not want my daughter going to the mosque for personal reasons. I don't agree with the religion and what it stands for - but I am not prepared to go into the reasons why. 'We have now been told our children are going to be excluded from RE lessons as a result, which is a big concern. 'We tried to go through the right channels but the school handled it very badly.' Sally Cox, 39, a self-employed cleaner from Lerryn, Cornwall, has also blocked her son Jed Pearce, 10, from going on the visit. She said: 'I did not want him to go because they are a violent religion and many of them have guns. 'You can see what they are like every day on the news. There was a Muslim bomber in Exeter just a few years ago. 'We were just being honest saying we did not want them to go. 'It is unsafe. I don't want my son being shot. Also this is not a religious school yet they are willing to take a whole day out for religion. 'I don't want them to do that. I want him to be in school learning Maths and English - not being put at risk of being shot. 'They decided to take him out of RE, but I said I am fine with that.' Nearly 100 primary pupils from Lostwithiel School in Cornwall were due to travel 68 miles to visit the mosque in Exeter, Devon (pictured) as part of an RE trip  but 10 pulled out after parents expressed 'grave concerns' Another parent, who did not want to be named, said: 'We have grave concerns about the children's safety during the trip due to the horrific events that occur every day. 'We have therefore decided not to send our children on this trip. This decision is not one based on ignorance or racial or religious beliefs, but one based purely on safety concerns.' The parent said she was furious after the pupils who pulled out of the trip were singled out in a school assembly. She said: 'They were made to stand up after assembly. The sitting non-attendees were then asked individually why they were not going on the trip. 'This is not a decision the children have made, so discriminating against these children in this fashion is disgraceful, unacceptable and unprofessional.' However, not all parents are opposed to the trip, with some backing the school and suggesting the visit is a positive move. Alice Mitchell, 35, a playworker from Lostwithiel, said: 'I think we need to educate our children to be tolerant and dispel the rumours the media can congregate. 'I am all for my children going on the trip. I think celebrating diversity is a great thing. 'It is all down to fear. People are scared of other religions. There is a lot of misconceptions.' And Sian Cornish, 41, a self-employed retailer, from Lostwithiel, added:' 'I did not even realise it was an issue. I was delighted my child had the opportunity to experience another culture in their ways of worship. 'I think it is important to celebrate other cultures - even if you don't agree with them.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of Lostwithiel School (pictured), which has just 156 pupils on its books, said the trip would still take place on May 7 to 'show children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam' Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the school, said a group of parents had expressed concerns about the trip due to recent terror attacks by groups such as ISIS. She said: 'This is the first time pupils from the school have visited a mosque and it's an exciting opportunity for them to learn about different faiths and ensure that they're aware of the diverse nature of modern Britain. 'Because of recent news reports about extremist groups, such as ISIS, that identify themselves with Islam, a small number of parents have expressed concerns about the trip and the teaching of Islam in school. 'In response, the school held a special assembly with children to discuss these issues, and the head teacher has met and sent letters to parents with specific concerns. 'A full risk assessment has been conducted for the trip and there is no more risk attached to this trip than any other school trip.' Ms Smith said the school had a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities. She said: 'Religious Education forms part of the basic curriculum in schools and its teaching is enshrined in law. Kat Smith, the chairman of governors for the Lostwithiel School, said parents expressed concerns about the teaching of Islam at the school . 'The school recognises that parents have the right to withdraw their child from RE in whole or in part, and provide alternative work to further their child's knowledge and understanding of the parents' beliefs and values. 'However, the school is aware that children growing up in Cornwall may have little contact with Muslims and it is aware that it has a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to promote good relations between people of different beliefs and ethnicities as part of its single equality duty. 'The Governing Body fully supports this trip and the teaching of RE, including Islam. 'It is the governors' hope that the visit to the mosque will provide an insight for pupils into the nature of British Islam, help them understand how Islam is presented in the media and that groups like ISIS are not a true reflection of the Islam followed by the vast majority of Muslims in Britain.' Carolyn Huxley, headteacher of the primary school which has just 156 pupils on its books and teaches those aged four to 11, said the trip would still be taking place on May 7. She said: 'Our hope from the visit to the mosque is that children will be given a view as to what are the values and beliefs of a British Muslim. 'This trip will show the children the views of extremists are not a true reflection of Islam as a religion.' Exeter Mosque, described as the 'Islamic Centre of the South West', is open daily for prayers and also welcomes those wishing to learn about the Quran and basics of the Deen. The Mosque also welcomes groups as part of education programmes and regularly hosts school trips. Lostwithiel School, which has around six teachers, said the trip was planned to enable children to learn further about different religions. The school said it follows the Cornwall Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education and part of the curriculum encourages children to study Christianity in great detail, as well as finding out about Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam through school trips, visits from outside speakers and class teaching. The Muslim Council of Great Britain said it was concerned by the views of some of the parents who strongly opposed the trip. A spokesman said: 'We would have thought a well-rounded education involves learning about those of a different faith. 'These laudable initiatives take place across the country. It is therefore disappointing to hear that some parents have chosen to pull their children out of a visit to a mosque due to events elsewhere in the world. 'We hope this incident is atypical and not reflective of a growing sentiment against Muslims in this country. 'We commend the headteacher for rightly stating that such a visit will help her pupils to understand real Islam and dispel the myths and hysteria that surrounds our religion.' MailOnline has contacted Exeter Mosque for comment.","10 pupils pull out of trip to mosque after parents express 'grave concerns'

17,"Fearing for their lives, hundreds of African immigrants have begun arriving in their home countries after fleeing the bloody violence that has swept across South Africa. Among them were some 400 Zimbabweans –  including pregnant women and babies – who were packed onto buses to escape the anti-immigrant attacks that have left seven people dead in recent days. They were pictured wearily disembarking in the safe haven of a migration centre  in the Zimbabwean border town of Beitbridge after leaving Durban yesterday. About 3,200 Malawians have also sought refuge in temporary camps amid the ensuing chaos. Their plight emerged as South Africa's influential Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini denied whipping up the xenophobic hatred in the country that has forced thousands from their homes. Scroll down for video . Safe haven: Zimbabwe victims of xenophobic attacks in South Africa disembark from a bus on arrival at the International Organisation for Migration Reception and Support Centre in Beitbridge, Zimbabwe . Shock: A pregnant woman stands in a registration queue awaiting her turn at the International Organisation for Migration Reception and Support Centre in Beitbridge, after fleeing attacks that have seven people dead .

Stunned: Venge Mundai, a survivor of the xenophobic violence is looked after by a doctor inside a makeshift clinic at the International Organisation for Migration Reception and Support Centre in Beitbridge . Zwelithini had made an angry speech last month blaming immigrants for rising crime and saying they must leave the country, in an outburst seen as inciting the spate of attacks. But addressing a tribal gathering of several thousand Zulus in the port city of Durban the king insisted he had been taken out of context. 'My speech... was directed at the police, calling for stricter law enforcement, but that was never reported,' he said. 'The public was instead given another side of my speech, which has been twisted and misrepresented. This violence directed at our brothers and sisters is shameful.' Meanwhile, in Malawi, Information Minister Kondwani Nankhumwa said six buses carrying 390 Malawians from Durban were sent to Malawi yesterday, while five more buses were expected to leave today. Those killed in the anti-immigrant unrest included two Malawians, according to Malawi's government. Louis Lulu Mnguni, South Africa's top diplomat in Nigeria, said his Lagos mission has warned South African citizens in Nigeria 'to exercise vigilance and limit their movements' following threats of reprisal attacks. Malawian families fleeing xenophobic violence disembark a bus at Kamudzu stadium  in Blantyre, after being repatriated from South Africa . A group of 390 Malawians fleeing xenophobic violence wait at Kamudzu stadium  in Blantyre. South African authorities have struggled to contain mobs in the economic capital Johannesburg and Durban who have been attacking foreigners from Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and other African countries . Similarly, security was increased at the South African High Commission in Accra, Ghana, after telephoned threats, said Lulama Xingwana, the high commissioner. Activists in some African countries have also organised protests and called for a boycott of South African goods as South Africa is a powerful trading partner in the region. Kenmare Resources, a Dublin-based company, said it temporarily repatriated its 62 South African workers at a titanium mine in Mozambique after 'reciprocal unrest' there that stemmed from the South African violence. The mine's total workforce is nearly 1,400. The outbreak of violence in South Africa against immigrants has tarnished the reputation of a country that has one of the biggest economies on the continent and has been a destination for people seeking opportunity and an escape from turbulence elsewhere in Africa. Horrific pictures released yesterday showed a Mozambican man bleeding to death in a gutter after being savagely attack by a gang who stabbed him with knives and bludgeoned him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg. In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself. South Africa was also dubbed the 'rainbow nation' for its relatively peaceful transition to democracy after the end of white racist rule in 1994. Attack: Shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround Emmanuel Sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg . Now the government is struggling to contain negative fallout from attacks on immigrants in some areas of Durban and Johannesburg that killed seven people since the end of March. Professor Chris Landsberg, an African diplomacy and foreign policy expert at the University of Johannesburg said the South African government should be 'less reactive and more proactive' in dealing with tensions over immigrants. He said the country should 'be a bit more humble' about its aspirations as a continental leader, adding: 'We are in denial.' Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, an influential figure among the Zulu ethnic group in South Africa, condemned the attacks in a speech Monday at a Durban sports stadium. His remarks followed allegations that he provoked the violence with reported comments in which he said foreigners should go home. Doctors tried in vain to save Mr Sithole's life. His cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket . President Jacob Zuma postponed a ceremony, scheduled for next week, in which the country's highest official honor is bestowed on South Africans and foreigners who have contributed to South Africa, his office said. The event will be postponed so South Africa can mourn the victims of the anti-immigrant violence, including three South Africans and four foreigners, it said. The attacks in South Africa stem from a perception that immigrants, many from other African countries, are taking jobs at the expense of South Africans in a country with high unemployment. Many people have entered South Africa illegally, though the government has said a large number of immigrants are working legally and contributing to economic development. The violence recalls similar unrest in South Africa in 2008 in which 60 people died. In January this year, four people died during looting of foreign-owned shops in areas of Johannesburg. The violence is particularly unfortunate because other African nations provided shelter and other aid to South African activists during the battle against white minority rule, said Xingwana, the South African diplomat in Ghana. 'The young people have forgotten the contribution of African countries to South Africa's fight against apartheid and need to be educated on this,' she said.","400 Zimbabweans fled Durban on buses to escape the xenophobic protests .

The 35-year-old wasn't celebrating a cup triumph but the millions flowing through his accounts from an alleged £30million investment scheme that snared a string of top-flight players. Pictures have now emerged of McIndoe in 2011 - at the height of his scheme - surrounded by beautiful women and empty champagne bottles as he revelled in a millionaire playboy's lifestyle in Marbella with a limitless credit card and wads of cash.

McIndoe (second from the right) parties in Marbella using money earned from the elaborate scheme . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then took advantage of the Bulls' financial plight and snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. But the former Wolves and Coventry midfielder, who is accused of persuading 300 stars including Jimmy Bullard as well as a string of lower league players to invest with him, is now being investigated by police. He was forced into a bankruptcy court with debts approaching £3m earlier this month where he claimed to be penniless and living on the charity of friends and family. The Metropolitan Police are investigating and have started quizzing victims and associates. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme, which promised a 20 per cent return on investments. McIndoe, from Edinburgh, hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club, in London. But it was in Marbella that McIndoe indulged the lavish lifestyle - shown in these exclusive photos - he could not afford as his playing career ended in non-league football. He hired a modernist £2m mansion for £27,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree and spent £40,000 on champagne in one day at a beach club party. Friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs. McIndoe celebrates scoring for Doncaster against Arsenal in the League Cup in 2005 .

The former Scotland B player rented a £27,000-a-week mansion for a three-week holiday in Spain . 'There were lots of girls and lots of drink,' said the player, who had been befriended by McIndoe when he was a young apprentice at the same club. 'He was spending money like you've never seen before.' McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. The player added that McIndoe targeted fellow professionals and businessmen football supporters and initially gave them the 20 per cent return paid monthly in cash. The scheme sucked in around 300 players and the former QPR and Hull star Bullard is thought to have lost around £600,000 which prompted him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.

McIndoe lived at the five-star Mayfair Hotel, paying £4,000 a week for a suite, and also rented a Belgravia apartment for an upfront £150,000 annual fee, it is alleged. He ran glitzy parties at celebrity nightclubs including Funky Buddha, in London, and drove around in a Bentley and a Maybach. He was reportedly gambling heavily before the scheme crashed and is said to have run through £1m on bets with one bookmaker in a year. 'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.'

Another person to have been caught out by the former Scotland B international was glamour model Georgia Eden, who was one of 30 women hired to attend club nights organised by McIndoe. In total, McIndoe was due to pay the model agency who organised the women £12,000, but the money never materialised. Speaking to the Daily Record, Eden said: 'We were asked to mingle around and talk to guests in the club. The organisers said they were really pleased with what we had done and we were told we would be paid within 30 days. Georgia Eden was one of 30 models hired to attend a event put on at a club by McIndoe . But Eden, along with her colleagues, was never paid for her work with the agency said to be owed £12,000 .

'To have that amount of girls booked for one job was a really big deal so it was a big let down to not be paid for the work we had done.' McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £2.4m. He told the London bankruptcy court this month that he had no income and was living off £13,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but £6,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex. 'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing. He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London. After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment. 'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. The hearing was adjourned until March 25 and he must attend a meeting with the bankruptcy trustee later this month.

21,"Wildfires raged along Cape Town's famous mountains for a fourth day, destroying homes, a hotel and scorching thousands of hectares of spectacular scenery. Firefighting teams and water-bombing aircraft were still desperately trying to curb the spread of the flames sweeping down Cape Town's southern peninsula, a mountainous spine of land running from the city to Cape Point, Africa's most southwestern tip. It is believed the fire has already ravaged some 4,000 hectares of land - burning the flowering, shrub-like vegetation known as fynbos, part of the unique Cape floral kingdom. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: Geofrey Collings helps his 82-year-old wife Fran through the wreckage of their home, which was destroyed by the fire . Raging: Fires caught on both sides of the famous peninsula, closing the famous Chapman's Peak Drive as it burned above Hout Bay (pictured) Lucky: So far, there have been no reported fatalities or serious injuries due to the fire - although people have been treated for smoke inhallation . It has also destroyed or damaged at least 13 homes so far, as well as the five-star Tintswalo Atlantic Lodge, which is perched on the edge of the ocean near the fishing port and commuter village of Hout Bay. Luckily, no one is thought to have been killed or seriously injured, but dozens of people have been treated for smoke inhalation. Schools were closed and traffic snarled as residents awoke to a rain of ash and smoke drifting across an armageddon-like red ball of sun. The fires started as temperatures soared to their highest for the last 100 years of more than 40 degrees Celsius. As the blazes ripped along the mountainside on both sides of the famous pennisula, hundreds of residents living in the upmarket villages dotted along the Atlantic and False Bay coasts grabbed pets and valuables as they were evacuated overnight ahead of flames fanned by strong winds and record high temperatures. Appeals for food and cash to help victims, evacuees and volunteer firefighters have had an overwhelming response, officials said. Hard work: Firemen hose down smoldering logs in the Tokai Forest, near to the upmarket suburb of Constantia . Battle: Planes collect water from the sea and reservoirs nearby to dump on the forests in an attempt to stop the fire spreading . The mountains are home to fynbos, a type of shrub-like flora which is unique to the Western Cape . A 'RadioFirethon' on local station Cape Talk had raised more than R3million (about £166,000) by 5pm UK time. A German tourist staying in a rented house in the same area told eNCA television that he had a lucky escape in the early hours of Wednesday. 'I never experienced anything like this,' said the man, who gave his name only as Karl. 'When I saw (the flames) coming... I put my wife out of bed and we took what we could grab and went to the beach parking.' The couple were then escorted to a rescue centre. The fires have now moved along the coast, and are threatening homes near Fish Hoek, on the False Bay side of the peninsula, said Onele Ndesi, spokesman for Cape Town Disaster Risk Management. Just along the same stretch of coast, another fishing village had already come under threat: a sudden wind change overnight brought flames bearing down on Kalk Bay, a fishing village known for its seafood restaurants and antique shops. Devastating: Strong winds and high temperatures have made it difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze . Distraught: Geofrey Collings' home near the Tokai Forest home was one of 13 which have been either entirely or partly destroyed . Armageddon-like: The fires have transformed the usually stunning scenery into rivers of flames . Help: A resident covers face with a cloth as she walks in smoke to help fight fires threatening homes in Clovelly, near Fish Hoek . However, officials were hopeful a change in the weather -including some rain - might bring some relief. The fynbos-covered mountains and spectacular coastline are the backdrop to the annual Cape Town Cycle Tour, a 109 kilometre race around the peninsula, which is due to be held on Sunday. The race is described as the 'largest timed cycling event in the world', and has drawn 35,000 entrants from South Africa and around the world this year. Organisers were expected to announce this week whether the fires will force a change in the route. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille said she was confident the fire would be out in time for the race to take place. 'It is known as the most scenic cycle tour in the world but now it will tour through some of the greatest devastation that the peninsula has ever seen, which will be heart-wrenching,' she said.","Cape Town's spectacular scenery has been ravaged by four days of fires - destroying or damaging 13 homes .

24,"An Australian rebel fighter has been showing off his new pet on social media after buying a tiger cub whilst fighting in Syria. The photo shows a beautiful young tiger cub in the hands of a freelance rebel fighter, known as Ahmed Shaheed. The extravagant purchase will remain with its mother until it is old enough to become Shaheed's pet. The 28-year-old fighter from Sydney, showed off his new furry investment, posting a picture of the tiger cub on his social media account. His extravagant purchase was met with surprise by one of his fellow fighters, Abou Shaheed al-Muhajir. Unwilling to reveal the cost of his furry investment, the fighter did confirm that he had bought the tiger cub from a small village, near the Syrian city of Aleppo, where he has recently been based. The news comes just a month after the 28-year-old revealed on social media that he was looking to buy an exotic pet to keep him company. Photos of three potential pets were tweeted by Ahmed Shaheed, starting with a sad leopard sitting in a dirty cage. He commented: 'I just made the zoo keeper an offer for this, he said no to start off but the dollar goes a long way.' The wealthy gunslinger also tweeted a picture of a little owl. Possibly due to its three year life expectancy, the grumpy looking owl didn't seem to particularly interest the rebel. The surprising news comes just a month after the 28-year-old revealed on social media that he was looking to buy an exotic pet to keep him company. A sad leopard sitting in a dirty cage, was the first possible animal that took the fighter's interest. Shaheed preferred the tiger despite it costing more money. Possibly due to its short life expectancy, the grumpy looking owl didn't seem to particularly interest the rebel. Unwilling to reveal the cost of his furry investment, the fighter only confirmed that he had bought the tiger cub from a small village, near the Syrian city of Aleppo. Keen to get opinions on the owl, Shaheed wrote: 'Or should I buy this one and teach it to send messages.' However it was the tiger that really appeared to attract the Aussie fighter's attention. Sitting alone in his den, the beautiful large tiger is pictured sitting proudly in the shade. Unusually it wasn't just the tiger cub that seemed to be the big talking point from new photo. A few social media users appear to be more concerned by the fighter's apparent lack of facial hair in the photo. Despite claiming to have been fighting in Syria for well over a year, the Aussie fighter's neck and chin area appear to be cleanly shaved. Keen to hide his identity, the former Bond university student posted an obscured photo of himself stroking a four month old lion. The fighter recently showed off his war booty of $525 and a Kalashnikov rifle, possibly explaining how he managed to pay for the tiger cub. One user cheekily wrote on Shaheed's Ask.Fm page: 'Is that u holding the tiger? Cause the beard should be longer to appear for someone who been there more than year and a half lol' With his ego bruised, the 28-year-old militant swiftly replied back, insisting he was looking up at the sky for any potential incoming fire from jets. 'I'm looking up at the sky in that pic thought i heard a jet. Is this advice on my beard coming from someone still chilling in darul kufr (land of the disbelievers) while jihad is fard ayn (obligatory)?' Shaheed is not the first fighter to purchase a pet tiger. Deputy commander of rebel group Jaish al-Mujahideen wal-Ansar, Abdul Karim Krymsky, was pictured holding a young tiger last month. Shaheed is not the first fighter to show off a pet tiger, colossal Chechen fighter Abdul Karim Krymsky posed with another tiger. Ahmed Shaheed is believed to be a former Bond University student, who reportedly left his home in Sydney and traveled to Syria to join the Al Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra. According to his Ask.Fm page, Ahmed became disillusioned with Jabhat al-Nusra and left the group. When asked who he is fighting for now, he wrote he was 'doing my own thing.' It is possible that Ahmed Shaheed has joined another rebel group in the Aleppo Liberation,based around the broken city of Aleppo. Asked why he chose not to join ISIS, Shaheed was clear: 'Dawla (ISIS) seems to be only involved in the infighting in Sham (Syria) and restricted to a few cities in sham. I want to travel the whole of syria fighting Bashar (al-Assad) and his allies, staying away from any group involved in infighting.' Shaheed posted a picture of his fellow fighter, Abu Baraa, in Doureen, near the Alawite dominated port city of Latakia. Keen to document his travels whilst fighting around Syria, Ahmed posted a picture of a well preserved Roman ruins in Hama province.","The photo shows a beautiful young tiger cub in the hands of a rebel fighter, known as Ahmed Shaheed .

25,"(CNN)A Louisiana judge ruled Monday that Robert Durst, the millionaire real estate heir charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail. That's no big surprise. In 2001 -- the last time he was accused of murder and released on bail -- Durst fled to Pennsylvania, where authorities caught him after he tried to shoplift a sandwich from a supermarket. As the attorneys sparred in court and witnesses testified Monday, they revealed new details about the investigation that led to Durst's March 14 arrest, and set the stage for what will surely be a fierce legal battle. After the hearing, Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, spoke with CNN's Jean Casarez. Here are some key details from Monday's hearing and the interview: . Durst, who appeared in court wearing an orange prison uniform and shackles, was arrested after federal agents tracked his cell phone, according to information presented in court Monday. Investigators knew he'd left his Houston condo with five suitcases on March 10. And, since a warrant allowed them to track his cell phone, they saw when it pinged a tower 85 miles east, in Beaumont, Texas. But suddenly, he had stopped using it. Investigators thought the trail had gone cold. ""They had no indication of his movement,"" said Jim O'Hearn, an investigator for the Orleans Parish district attorney's office. But then, authorities tracked him to New Orleans after he called his voice mail twice from a Marriott there, O'Hearn testified. That's where FBI agents found and arrested him. Last week, court documents revealed Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, 5 ounces of marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a neck-to-head latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash, mostly in $100 bills. Among his possessions, he also had a UPS tracking number. The package was later intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said in court Monday. It contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. It's a case Durst even has made himself. In ""The Jinx,"" the HBO documentary that featured him, Durst said: ""You can't give someone charged with murder bail because they're going to run away, of course. Goodbye, $250,000. Goodbye, jail. I'm out."" In a seconds-long news conference after the hearing Monday, Durst attorney DeGuerin said he had no hope for bail and the judge's decision was not surprising. The legal team, however, did obtain ""a lot of information,"" he said, and a preliminary hearing was set for April 2. ""All in all, I think this has been a very good day for us,"" he said on the courthouse steps. He walked off without elaborating. DeGuerin cast doubt Monday on the validity of the Los Angeles arrest warrant that led to Durst's detention, and argued that items found in the hotel room search shouldn't be admissible because detectives may not have had a search warrant at the time. He also said a detective and prosecutor interrogated Durst for three hours without his attorney present. Since the weapons and drugs charges Durst faces in New Orleans are based on what investigators say they found in his hotel room, this is likely to come up again. But prosecutors argued that the matter at hand Monday was whether he is a flight risk or a danger to the community. The judge sided with the prosecution Monday. But this is just the first step in what will likely be a lengthy legal battle. ""As long as Louisiana wants us here, well, we'll stay here. We'll fight,"" DeGuerin said Monday. But the bigger courtroom fight will likely unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last week. Durst awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of ""lying in wait"" and killing Susan Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she ""was a witness to a crime."" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills, California, home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Robert Durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. ""I just don't think that they had sufficient evidence to have him arrested,"" DeGuerin said Monday. ""They had a lot of suspicion. They've always had a lot of suspicion. And that television show just added to that suspicion."" It's not the first time Durst has been accused of murder. He admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. On Monday, police said there was a connection between Durst and a college student who disappeared from Vermont's Middlebury College in 1971. In response to a question at a Tuesday news conference from CNN, Middlebury Police Chief Tom Hanley said: ""There's nothing in the files to indicate (Durst) was questioned"" at the time of her disappearance. ""We don't know if they ever had any personal contact,"" the chief added.  The connection in the case was one of proximity, Hanley said. Durst owned a health-food store in Middlebury, and Lynne Schulze was last seen across the street from the store near a bus stop. She had purchased dried prunes from the store earlier. DeGuerin brushed off the accusation, saying that his client ""may have been in Chicago when Jimmy Hoffa disappeared."" Other cases in upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are also getting a new look. Durst was placed on suicide watch, according to police, but DeGuerin said last week that Durst needed to be in a hospital setting, not because of the possibility of suicide, but because he has serious medical conditions. The 71-year-old is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said last week. ""At the same time he was in the hospital he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,"" DeGuerin said. Durst appeared in court Monday with his head shaved, the stent prominent. DeGuerin also said that Durst is ""mildly autistic"" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism. ""He's quiet and he's reserved and he's actually bashful. But he's always been looked upon as a little bit odd,"" DeGuerin said. ""And what we discovered 15 years ago was that he's autistic, mildly autistic, but it explains a lot of his, what others look upon as unusual or bizarre behavior."" But DeGuerin said his client's health struggles don't mean he's incompetent to stand trial. And DeGuerin said they're eager to go to court and fight the accusations against him. ""He's a little frail and he has some memory problems sometimes,"" DeGuerin said. ""But he's not incompetent."" CNN's Anne Woolsey, Amanda Watts, Jean Casarez and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","Police chief in Vermont says Robert Durst owned store where college student bought prunes before she disappeared .

Pastor Michael Dietrich, from the Lutheran church in Montabaur, spoke out following the fatal crash  that claimed the lives of 150 people.

Community spirit: People leave the church  in Montabaur, following the service to commemorate the crash victims and support their families . Elsewhere, Pope Francis yesterday remembered the dead as he opened solemn Holy Week services in front of some 70,000 faithful at the Vatican. Mr Dietrich said: ‘For us, it makes it particularly difficult that the only victim from Montabaur is suspected to have caused this tragedy.’ He added: ‘The co-pilot, the family belong to our community, and we stand by this, and we embrace them and will not hide this.’ The pastor added that there is no direct contact with the family at the moment, but that he believes they are receiving good assistance. French prosecutors have not yet questioned the family ‘out of decency and respect for their pain’, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said. Mr Dietrich said he knew Lubitz as a teenager, when he undertook religious education 13 years ago, and his mother, a part-time organist.

He added: ‘When I worked with her or talked to her, it was very good and very harmonious. We had good conversations. I know her and her family. 'This does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family. 'From what I've heard, there were no obvious signs that there is anything in the background that could lead to this.’ Meanwhile Francis prayed for those who died in the tragedy, at the end of Palm Sunday Mass outside St Peter's Basilica yesterday. The 78-year-old pontiff cited in particular the 16 German students returning on Flight 4U9525 from an exchange trip to Spain. In addition, another pastor in Montabaur, Father Johannes Seemann, added that the community was grieving with the Lubitz family, reported Bild. Together: People attend a special Mass to honour the victims of the crash, at the cathedral Notre Dame de Bourg, in Digne-les-Bains, France . Co-pilot: The disaster killed 150 people, including Andreas Lubitz (above) who investigators say deliberately crashed the jet into the mountain . On guard: Police near the house where Lubitz lived in Montabaur - a community that is struggling to come to terms with the past week's events . Two wardens at his service asked God: ‘Have you forgotten the people who were sitting on the plane from Barcelona? Why did not you protect them?’ In Le Vernet, a town near the crash site, families and friends of those killed were still coming to terms with what had happened. ‘Members of the family shed tears as they went to see the site,’ said Ippei Yamanaka, co-worker of Japanese passenger Junichi Sato who died in the crash. ‘It was particularly moving to see Mr Sato's father asking the leader of the Kempeitai (a Japanese military rescue team), with many tears in his eyes, for them to continue the search operation and for it to finish earlier even by just one day. ‘His wife says she still she cannot believe what has happened, saying that it almost feels like her husband is away on his business trip and that it still feels like he is going to return soon.’ Among the tributes left near the crash site in France included one saying: ‘I thank you for everything. You have given me a wonderful life, full of beautiful things.’","Disaster killed 150 people including co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who 'deliberately crashed plane into the mountain'

28,"It sat on a stark white block in a vast room that resembled a laboratory. I was at the SculptureCenter in the New York borough of Queens, a spot dedicated to all things modern and avant garde. Taking pride of place was a cluster of bottles, each of which contained dog fluff and a photo of the mutt it came from. ‘We’re running a competition to find new talent,’ explained the black-clad curator, brightly. ‘Maybe I’ll shave the cat next time I visit my parents,’ I thought to myself. ‘If I stick the fluff in a bottle, it might just win.’ Cultural revolution: New York is in the throes of a cultural revolution - but MOMA is still brilliant . Welcome, then, to Nu York, a city that bears no resemblance to the version depicted in Friends and Gossip Girl and instead centres around a throbbing contemporary arts scene largely based in Brooklyn and Queens - the latter the beneficiary of a recent gentrification programme. Gone (mostly) are the rough tenements and in their place, a bustling network of shop-lined streets and some seriously classy bars and hotels. Among the latter was the Z Hotel, a stark block of a building decked out in the industrial-chic style so beloved of London hipsters. Stateside Shoreditch, as it were. It was all a far cry from Iceland where I had begun my trip, courtesy of an Icelandair wheeze that gives you the option of stopping off to see the sights of Reykjavik and the spectacular Golden Circle for up to seven days en route to Boston, Anchorage, Washington or, in my case, New York. Although still on the global naughty step thanks to a calamitous economic meltdown in 2009, the Icelandic capital shows signs of recovery – not least in the form of the revellers that lined the street outside the Apotek Hotel, a gloriously Scandinavian-looking place to stay, as I arrived at midnight following an evening flight from London. The next morning, I dragged myself out of bed for a Viking-style cooking class at Salt Eldhus where I learned to cook barley risotto and salt and pepper salmon – the perfect way, as it turned out, to fortify me for the dramatic scenery that came next. Stunning: The Gullfoss Waterfall in Pingvellir National Park is a short hop from Reykjavik . Awe-inspiring: Geysir is home to a row of geysers that fire boiling water and a sulphurous stench into the air . Covered with a thick layer of snow, Pingvellir National Park sits atop the fault line that separates the American continent from the European one and provides Iceland with its volcanoes, geysers and geothermal springs. The site of Iceland’s first parliament, it’s a short hop from Geysir, where a series of geysers explode in a shower of boiling water and revolting sulphurous stench every five minutes or so. Slipping and sliding on the ice, the first explosion caught me unawares and forced me to jump back. At the next one, I held my nerve, looking smugly round at the tourists who had been caught on the hop like I had been. Then came a trip to Friðheimar, a series of greenhouses filled with tomato plants and set next to a stable crammed with hairy Icelandic ponies. The glowing buildings were an odd sight, although the produce was second to none, but even that paled in comparison to the Secret Spring – a bubbling pool flanked by a geyser and lit, on clear nights, by the shimmering green and purple glow of the Northern Lights. Sitting there, watching them ripple, was truly magical. The next morning, it was off to New York which, with its claustrophobic cluster of skyscrapers and determinedly chic inhabitants, was a very different prospect indeed. While Iceland, like the rest of Scandinavia, boasts an effortless flair for design and a natural cool, the Big Apple has clearly worked on it. Beneath the too-cool-for-school surface, however, lies some old-fashioned Americana – not least in the all-American charm of the cheerful locals. Looking cool: Williamsburg, home to Jake Gyllenhaal among others, is awash with artisan bars . New look: Queens has had a makeover, with tough neighbourhoods replaced with cool shops and chic bars . Among them are the staff at the Roger Smith Hotel in Manhattan, who took a break from watching the Super Bowl to ply me with burgers and fries as I arrived, dishevelled, following a five-hour flight from Reykjavik. The next morning, after an all-American breakfast of bacon and waffles, I left the chintzy charms of the Roger Smith behind for a visit to MOMA, the epicentre of New York’s cultural cool. A fabulous place set in a glass and steel building over several floors, it is crammed with modern art dating from the mid-18th century onwards. Matisse, Monet and Picasso are there in numbers, as are Frieda Kahlo and Andy Warhol. Rothko, Malevich and Seurat dot its walls, as does some appalling stuff by the likes of Jean-Pierre Basquiat – avoid that and stick to the good bits on the third floor is my advice. Carrying bags of Warhol prints and a Sunday morning sized MOMA mug, we hopped into one of New York’s iconic yellow taxis for a short ride to low-rise Williamsburg, where another hipster favourite – craft beer – is taking hold. Beneath the pub where we ate lunch was a small collection of stills, where a variety of types, including one containing raw oysters, was being brewed. It was all delicious and a pleasant change from the Budweiser usually found in American bars. Artisan beer, artisan food and artisan art are all staples of New York’s burgeoning hipster culture, although to a cynical Brit like me, some of it felt a little try-hard. Brilliant: The Museum of Moving Image is set to become a New York must-visit - well worth going to . A case in point is the play Sleep No More, which made its début in London to critical rumblings and indifferent audiences but has become a real favourite in New York. Set in a warehouse over several floors, the idea is that you walk in at an unspecified point in the play (I managed to work out that it was a version of Macbeth but not everyone does) and follow the actors around attempting to get a handle on the action. Beginning in a wonderfully old-fashioned red-velvet lined bar, the action was compered by a chap with a British accent taken from the Dick van Dyke school of acting, who showed us into a lift and provided us with Scream-style masks before throwing us into the thick of things. Moving around the huge set, I walked into scene after scene and never really got much sense of the plot, although I did find myself becoming increasingly irritated with the hammy miming. Indeed, so disjointed was Sleep No More,   $20 booklets explaining the plot were being flogged to theatregoers, who had already paid $80 to get in, on their way out. Being unable to work out what it was all about is clearly a recurrent problem. Luckily for those whose tastes don’t stretch to baffling plays and bottles of dog fluff, New York still has much to love. Along with MOMA, there’s the brilliant Museum of Moving Image in Queens which takes you on a whistlestop tour through the US’ lengthy cinematic history with the help of a cleverly curated selection of pieces, among them the creepy doll which found fame in the Exorcist. Then there’s the bewildering selection of places to eat. In Queens alone, there’s everything from Brazilian to British and everything in between - and nearly all of it is delicious. And of course, there are all those iconic sights: the slow-moving Hudson River, the Rockerfeller Center, the Statue of Liberty and more. Nu York might not be to everyone’s taste but there’s no shortage of reasons to love the Big Apple – pulsating art scene and a quirky taste in plays included. Just don't make me watch Sleep No More again. Icelandair (icelandair.co.uk) flies from five UK airports including Birmingham to 14 North American destinations.

29,"When Steven Davis arrives back at Hampden for the first time in four years it is sure to be a bittersweet occasion for the former Rangers captain. The memories will come flooding back of his five cup finals as an Ibrox midfielder that ended with the Ibrox players being showered in champagne and drenched in adulation. There was a time when Davis dreamed life would always be like this; that his next trip to Mount Florida would be to add to those two Scottish Cups and three League Cup wins secured under Walter Smith. Southampton midfielder Steven Davis shoots at goal during a  match against West Ham last month . Yet those aspirations ended abruptly when the economics of the madhouse behind the scenes at Ibrox intersected with cold hard reality and Rangers plunged into the financial abyss in 2012. When Davis returns to the city to skipper Northern Ireland in a friendly with Scotland next Wednesday night, he knows he could face a hostile reception from the Rangers fans in the crowd who remain raw about the way their on-field leader walked out when the going got tough. Yet with no clarity on what the future held for the club under Charles Green, Davis was one of several leading players who opted to move on rather than remain to usher in the new era under Charles Green. While Davis takes no personal pleasure from vindication, time has shown his switch to high-flying Southampton to be a shrewd move, as Rangers have, by contrast, stumbled between alternating humiliations and crises over the last three years. And while the 30-year-old would understands any animosity, he hopes the fans realise he was left with no other realistic choice. Davis (centre) lifts the Scottish Cup trophy after Rangers beat Falkirk 1-0 in the 2009 final at Hampden . ‘I’m really looking forward to the match against Scotland,’ said Davis, who won three SPL titles and was a UEFA Cup Finalist between 2008 and 2012. ‘I’ve always wanted to get back up the road to catch a game but with the number of fixtures we have nowadays I haven’t managed. ‘I’ve fond memories from the majority of my appearances at Hampden and without doubt, I always hoped I’d play there a few more times with Rangers. When you enjoy as much success as we did in finals, you clearly want to continue in the same vein. ‘We always seemed to do well in the cup competitions but none of us – whether you were a fan or a player – could have foreseen what would happen at the club. ‘When you play football, you don’t really have your mind on anything else but with the publicity Rangers get, we started to get away from that. ‘When the new people came in, we didn’t know who we were dealing with and there was no dialogue in terms of telling us which direction the club was going in. ‘We never heard from the new owners about how they wanted to take the club forward or what their ambitions were for the next four or five years. Davis (centre) goes flying after being fouled during Northern Ireland's match against the Faroes last year . ‘We didn’t even hear how the next six months might pan out. There were no conversations had with us at all and it was an impossible situation for everybody. I didn’t ever get a phone call to say what the plans were or what the aims of the club were to try to progress. ‘I was the captain at the time so if I wasn’t getting a call, it’s fair to say I don’t think anyone else would have been either. ‘It was difficult because nobody really knew what sanctions were going to be applied and if we were going to be relegated or not. We were put in a position where we had to make a decision on our futures without knowing what the future might hold in store. ‘We had to make choices without knowing anything and the biggest thing from the club was there was a lack of communication so we didn’t know which way it was going. ‘I’m sure there will still be a few people who are unhappy with the way players left but we’ve seen a lot of things unravel in the last couple of years. Hindsight is a wonderful thing and everybody can now see the effect the new people had after they came in. ‘Maybe the fans can start to see where we were coming from and how we looked at it a bit better because of that.’ Davis (right) celebrates with his Rangers team-mates after the Ibrox club won the 2011 League Cup final . As Rangers struggle, Davis has been a key player in Southampton’s challenge for a European place this season. He has tended to keep his own counsel on the thorny issue of Rangers but when he joined Southampton, technically as a free agent, he pushed succeeded for the St Mary’s club to pay Rangers a fee. These days he just hopes the damage of three years of mismanagement at Ibrox can by repaired. ‘It is difficult to say anything in the media about it because you’re never going to come across the right way in everybody’s eyes,’ the 71-capped Ulsterman said. ‘It was obviously a difficult situation at the time but whenever I played, I always gave 100 per cent and I loved my time at Rangers. ‘I’ve got nothing but good memories of the fans, who were excellent with me and any supporters I’ve met since have only been positive. ‘At the time, a lot of things were said in the heat of the moment but over time, I think people have been able to see we had to make the best decisions for ourselves and our families. Davis (right) poses with Rangers manager Ally McCoist after winning the Scottish Premier League Player of the Month award for September 2011 . ‘For me, as an international player at 27 as I was then, I wanted to play at the highest level and I had to take everything into consideration. ‘As we didn’t have any real direction at Rangers we were being made aware of, we wanted to know what was happening but got nothing. ‘When I joined the club at first, there was no need to have that conversation because we simply went into every competition looking to win it. ‘That was clear. The fans demanded that, as did the players, but things changed and I hope Rangers can get back to that soon. ‘I’ve always wanted to get back to Ibrox to see a game and if it wasn’t for what happened, we could potentially all still be there just now. ‘It’s not like we were all angling for moves. At the time, we had a great dressing room and had had a lot of success over a number of years. There was no real need for any of us to look elsewhere and it was really unfortunate things went the way they did.’","Steven Davis returns to Hampden next week for the first time in four years .

30,"Outnumbered but definitely not outgunned. Trainer Mark Bradstock should adopt it as his stable motto. The Oxfordshire trainer will certainly be hoping that is the case when Coneygree bids to become the first novice to win the £550,000 Betfred Gold Cup since Captain Christy in 1974. Talk of such lofty ambition started after Bradstock and his assistant trainer wife, Sara, saw Coneygree stroll home by 40 lengths in the Kauto Star Novices’ Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day in only his second steeplechase. Oxfordshire trainer Mark Bradstock's Coneygree will b out to make history in the Betfred Gold Cup on Friday . Coneygree is running to be the first novice to win the £550,000 Betfred Gold Cup since Captain Christy in 1974 . Proof the performance was not a fluke came when Coneygree slammed Hennessy Gold Cup runner-up Houblon Des Obeaux by seven lengths in Newbury’s Denman Chase on February 7. Part of the credit for Coneygree’s performances has been shared with son Alfie. He is pursuing a showjumping career under the guidance of former international Graham Fletcher and regularly tutors Coneygree over the poles. Bradstock, who spent 12 years as assistant to legendary trainer Fulke Walwyn, said: ‘Coneygree’s strength is an incredibly high cruising speed and being able to efficiently jump at that speed, when most can’t. 'For a small stable like us to even have a runner at the Festival is fantastic, let alone a fancied one. ‘But I never feel like an underdog. We can put it up the bigger stables, even with their £250,000 horses, as 99 per cent of our horses are front-runners — they are fit and know how to jump.’ Coneygree won the Kauto Star Novices’ Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day in just his second steeplechase .

31,"Amid a torrent of rumours surrounding Rafa Benitez and his managerial future, the Spaniard quietly continued a phenomenal career trend on Thursday with Napoli. He took the Serie A side into the Europa League semi-final with an emphatic 6-3 aggregate victory over Wolfsburg and the impending encounters against Dnipro will be Benitez's seventh major European semi-final in 12 seasons. Napoli are the fourth club he has taken to the latter stages of a European competition, following spells with Valencia, Liverpool and Chelsea. Rafa Benitez (right) celebrates taking Napoli into the Europa League semi-final with striker Gonzalo Higuain . Benitez (centre) has reached his seventh European semi-final in only 12 seasons with four teams . Benitez (right) guided Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005, his first season at the club . Benitez got Liverpool back to the final of the competition in 2007, where they were beaten 2-1 by AC Milan . 2004: UEFA Cup winner (Valencia) 2005: Champions League winner (Liverpool) 2007: Champions League finalist (Liverpool) 2008: Champions League semi (Liverpool) 2010: Europa League semi (Liverpool) 2013: Europa League winner (Chelsea) 2015: Europa League semi (Napoli) Benitez tasted continental success for the first time with Valencia in 2004, lifting what was then the UEFA Cup after beating a Marseille side spearheaded by Didier Drogba 2-0 in the final. That achievement, alongside the two La Liga titles he won during his three-year spell at the Mestalla, caught the eye of Liverpool, who swooped to bring the Spaniard in as Gerard Houllier's replacement. His first Premier League season was one of adjustment but in Europe, Benitez flourished. He recorded his most stunning glory to date, masterminding what on paper was a woefully uninspiring Liverpool team to Champions League glory, overcoming a star-studded AC Milan side that boasted the likes of Cafu, Paolo Maldini, Kaka and Andriy Shevchenko in the final. Benitez maneuvered Liverpool back to the Champions League final in 2007, eliminating Barcelona on the way with a win at the Nou Camp, only for Milan to avenge their defeat two years prior with a 2-1 victory. The Spaniard  manipulated another assault on Europe's elite trophy the following year but Liverpool were knocked out in the semi-final by Chelsea. Off-field ownership turmoil derailed Benitez's team and Liverpool have not even threatened to emerge as a challenger for club football's most prestigious competition since. They were eliminated in the group stage of the tournament in 2010, where a third-placed finish resulted in demotion to the Europa League. But Benitez guided Liverpool to the semi-finals of Europe's secondary competition, where a Diego Forlan strike in extra-time at Anfield sent Atletico Madrid to the final, where they beat Roy Hodgson's Fulham. The Spaniard was sacked as Liverpool manager at the end of the 2010 season and Hodgson replaced Benitez, who ended up at Chelsea as interim manager in 2012 via a short spell at Inter Milan. Benitez won the Europa League with Chelsea, beating Benfica in the final, but his stay at Stamford Bridge was always going to be a short one. Benitez often barbed Chelsea supporters while at Anfield and with Jose Mourinho's time at Real Madrid grinding to a halt, it was clear who Benitez was keeping the Chelsea hotseat warm for. Now at Napoli, Benitez finds his future at the club in question due to meandering domestic form. Napoli are currently fourth in Serie A, five points away from the top three (which equals Champions League qualification in Italy) with seven games remaining until the end of the season, when the Spaniard's contract expires. Benitez was not a popular choice at Chelsea but he still delivered silverware with the Europa League . Benitez first won the trophy with Valencia in 2004 shortly before moving to Liverpool . Benitez is out of contract at Napoli at the end of the season and has been linked with Manchester City . Benitez has been linked with a return to England with Manchester City, as Manuel Pellegrini has overseen a feeble attempt at defending their Premier League title, while some Liverpool fans even pine for him to return to Anfield. If Benitez does leave Napoli at the end of the season, he will surely have an array of suitors. He has 12 major honours to his name. Few coaches across Europe posses a record as imposing as his.","Rafa Benitez's contract at Napoli expires at the end of the season .

36,"As heir to the Formula 1 empire, Tamara Ecclestone's childhood was no doubt a luxurious one. And it seems that she wants the same for her daughter Sophia, who celebrated turning one today with a lavish and extravagant birthday party in her honour. Tamara, 30, and husband Jay Rutland clearly wanted to give their only daughter a first birthday to remember - and they pulled out all the stops by creating 'Sophia's farmyard' in the garden of their London mansion. Scroll down for video . Happy birthday, Sophia! Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland celebrated daughter Sophia's first birthday by creating a farmyard for the tiny tot in the garden of their London mansion . Birthday girl: Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pyjamas on Instagram with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life' Zebras, sheep, puppies and ponies were just some of the animals that were seen arriving at the family home, which had been kitted out with pink balloons crafted into 'S' shapes in honour of the youngster. Each animal had its very own station complete with a gazebo and pink name sign and a balloon artist was also seen making his way into the family home. On Tuesday morning, Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pajamas on Instagram. The picture of the tiny tot wearing the outfit, which was emblazoned with her name and the number '1', was captioned with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life.' Fit for a princess: The entrance to the house was transformed into a balloon castle emblazoned with giant 'S' letters in the child's honour . Welcome to the farmyard: Each animal had its own station complete with a pink sign with its name on and a princess crown . Enjoying her special day: Tamara's little daughter Sophia seemed to be enjoying her special day in this Instagram shot of her playing with her new presents . Which was is the party? Guests and animal experts made their way into the event armed with little puppies on leads . Disneyland comes to London: Tamara even invited a real life princess along to join in the celebrations at her family home . Speaking about the event, Steven Duggan, who didn't organise this event but has organised events for the likes of Elton John and Adele, believes the event could have cost around £70,000. He said: 'This is a beautiful setting for Sophia on her birthday. 'We have done similar 1st birthday parties for high end clientele like Tamara Ecclestone before where our clients spent upwards of £70,000. It's a first birthday, if you can spoil them why not! It looks magical; a perfect fairytale party!'. Formerly of the party-girl persuasion, Tamara is embracing a more quiet life with open arms, confessing that 'parenting is so much better than going out partying'. And although Tamara  is clearly loving having a little girl, she does admit that it does come with its less-than-glamorous challenges. Speaking to new! magazine about the joys of being a parent, she admitted that there are moments that are rather embarrassing. 'After having a baby, all your dignity goes out of the window!' she joked, adding that some of her most mortifying moments in her first year of having a baby include 'breast leakage' and 'poo on her jeans'. Special guest: A zebra was spotted being led into the Ecclestone/Rutland home ahead of their daughter's party . Coming through! An adorable cage load of puppies were also dragged into the family home to join in the lavish celebrations . Gifts galore: She may only be one year old but Sophia is certainly starting life off in the laps of luxury . Let me entertain you: A balloon artist was seen arriving at the London home with a bag full of surprises for the baby . Ready to party!

A courier company were seen arriving at the house with a huge delivery . A luxury London zoo: Zebras made their way into Sophia's farmyard ahead of the little girl's first birthday party celebrations . However, the more disgusting 'perks' of having a young one aside, the 30-year-old is thoroughly enjoying her life as a mother, admitting that she's put her former lifestyle behind her for a more wholesome, honest living. 'The love that you feel is so much deeper,' she said. 'I don't have tolerance for bulls**t now. I don't waste time with fakeness. Sophia's my priority. She's really turned my life upside down – for the better.' The beautiful brunette socialite also opened up about the fact she and husband Jay Rutland are still sharing a bed with their tot, but that it's not a problem for them. Speaking in an interview with Hello magazine last year, Tamara - who gave birth to Sophia last March, her first child - revealed that she was a 'hands-on' mother even though she admitted it can be tiring. 'I'm totally exhausted all the time, but I don't care because it's a happy exhaustion,' she explained. 'I'm not drinking or having coffee and I'm being so healthy for Sophia. 'I'm sorry, but I'm completely obsessed with Sophia. I love her so much I'm like a crazy woman.' Tamara and her daughter were last week spotted enjoying a day out in Hyde Park, where they were duck spotting. Their little outing came just before Tamara and husband Jay and their daughter flew out to Milan for another of their many getaways, before also taking a 24-hour round-trip from the city to the glorious Lake Como in the north of Italy. Little Sophia was blissfully unaware of her luxury surrounding as she boarded a private plane with her mother. Jay, to whom Tamara has been married since 2013, chose to celebrate his 34th birthday with the quick getaway in the idyllic location, where they enjoyed a night at the Villa D’Este Hotel .

Police in Limington, Maine, had been responding to reports that an apparently drunk woman was walking in and out of traffic and laying in the road on Saturday afternoon. Rebecca Grant, 40, initially claimed that she had been kidnapped and abused, but when she refused to give the name of her captors, police checked her ID and found that she was out on bail. Once York County sheriff’s deputies learned she had bail conditions not to possess or consume alcohol they went to arrest her, Sheriff William King said. However, at this point, she became violent, and attempted to head-butt a deputy sheriff before 'thrusting her head onto the trunk of his cruiser on two occasions,' Bangor Daily News reports. Once Grant, from Biddeford, had been subdued and placed in the police car, officers found white residue on her teeth. They then discovered a three-inch scratch mark in the paint of the trunk, concluding that she had, in fact, 'bitten' the patrol cruiser. Enroute to York County Jail, Grant bit the upholstery, tearing the material, causing $500 worth of damage. She also attempted to kick out the car window, Sheriff King said. In addition, the 40-year-old allegedly threatened to kill deputies and their families. Grant was charged with violating her bail conditions and criminal mischief for causing $500 in damage to the cruiser. She remained jailed Tuesday on a $200 cash bail at the York County Jail in Alfred.

42,"Tragedy: Ian Anderson says he watched as police shot his service dog Burberry . A man lost his best friend on Sunday after he says a police officer shot and killed his beloved service dog Burberry while responding to a call in the neighborhood. Ian Anderson of San Diego says he's absolutely heartbroken after being forced to watch police shoot his 6-year-old pit bull Burberry over the weekend. He says it's all because the dog was spooked and was barking. NBC reports that officers were called just before 5:30 a.m. on Sunday for a domestic disturbance call in Anderson's neighborhood. When police arrived they were confronted by the 50 to 60 pound dog Burberry  and one of the officers fired his gun. Anderson claims that Burberry started barking when police knocked on his door and that they even had the wrong address for the domestic dispute call. He says that no arrests were made that night. Anderson says one officer petted the pit bull but that the other officer reacted with fear at seeing the dog and hearing him bark. 'The other officer yelled and screamed at the dog for no reason to get inside. It startled the dog,' Anderson said. '[The officer] jumped back, went this way, drew his weapon,' he said. 'Boom. Shot right in the head and he was done. He was dead.' Dead: Burberry, 6, was a service dog who helped children with Down syndrome and aided Ian Anderson with his debilitating anxiety following the death of his father . Anderson says his dog was the best dog that anyone could ever ask for and that he helped children with Down syndrome. Anderson said that dog also helped him to overcome his debilitating sadness after losing his father. 'They’re there to put their heads on your lap and you know everything is going to be okay. There's just no way to explain the bond,' he said. Member of the family: Ian Anderson says that Burberry was the best dog anyone could ever ask for and was like a member of his family . Surveillance: There is footage of the shooting and a police officer can be seen petting the dog as another officer later shoots the dog in the head once it starts barking . 'He was the best dog in the entire world,' Anderson said as he held back his tears. 'I would do anything to have him back right now. Absolutely anything. The San Diego Police Department issued a statement following the incident. 'The preservation of life is our top priority and this includes the lives of animals. This incident is currently being investigated as any Officer Involved Shooting would be to assure proper procedures were followed. Any further comments prior to the completion of the investigation would simply be premature.' Service dog: Burberry was dedicated to helping children with Down syndrome as a certified service dog .

44,"Premiership Rugby's longest-ever broadcasting rights deal with BT Sport could lead to another rise in the competition's salary cap. Chief executive Mark McCafferty admitted the four-year contract extension with BT Sport will feature in talks over setting the salary cap level for the 2016-17 Aviva Premiership season. Premiership bosses confirmed the new BT deal on Monday, extending the existing four-year contract until 2021. Premiership Rugby Chief executive Mark McCafferty admits the new BT Sport deal could raise the salary cap . McCafferty accepted the salary cap could 'possibly' rise again off the back of the BT deal - but not straight away. 'We've got the salary cap levels in place for the 2015-16 season next year, and we will start discussions with the clubs over the next few months on the cap for 2016-17 onwards,' said McCafferty. 'No doubt the new BT deal gives us some certainty against which to plan those discussions.' Premiership chiefs netted £152million when agreeing their first deal with BT Sport in 2012, and this new extension is expected to command a sizeable increase. The salary cap for the Aviva Premiership will be discussed for 2016-17 onwards in the next few months . Premiership clubs continue to battle the lure of big-money moves to France in the bid to retain their top stars. Northampton skipper Dylan Hartley rejected several lucrative contract offers from French clubs to commit to Franklin's Gardens earlier this season however, and league bosses will hope increasing revenue through deals similar to the BT contract will continue to boost that ongoing fight. The Premiership's salary cap is already set to rise to £5.1million for 2015-16, with clubs able to gain £400,000 in credits for the number of home-grown players in their squad. Premiership clubs will also be able to nominate two marquee players, whose salaries are not included in the cap. McCafferty believes progressive sponsorship and commercial arrangements like the new BT deal will continue to help Premiership clubs build squads potent both at home and abroad.

50,"(CNN)Most kids want to go out and play when they finish their homework early. But Zuriel Oduwole isn't ""most kids."" When she gets ahead of her work, she packs her camera and microphones, jumps on a plane and interviews presidents instead. Born in California to a Nigerian father and a Mauritian mother, Oduwole is often described as ""the world's youngest filmmaker."" Aged 12, she already has four documentaries under her belt -- all of which focus on African issues. It all started three years ago when Oduwole decided to enter a school documentary-making competition with a film about the Ghana revolution. Jerry John Rawlings (Ghana) John Kufour (Ghana) Joyce Banda (Malawi) Jakaya Kikwete (Tanzania) Rajkeswur Purryag (Mauritius) Uhuru Kenyatta (Kenya) Goodluck Johnathan (Nigeria) Salva Kirr Mayardit (South Sudan) Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (Liberia) Jorge Fonseco (Cape Verde) Portia Simpson Miller (Jamaica) Thomas Thabane (Lesotho) Ralph Gonsalves (St Vincent & Grenadines) Denzil Douglas (St Kitts & Nevis) After this first foray into filmmaking, Oduwole was bitten by the director's bug and quickly wanted to make more movies. She turned to the web to find the tools she needed and got involved in the entire filmmaking process. ""As I edit, produce, set up and write the scripts for my documentaries, I have to learn a lot of things,"" says Oduwole, who is self-taught and uses online editing and voice software. Her second outing, ""Educating and Healing Africa Out of Poverty,"" looked at the creation of the African Union in 1963. She followed it up in 2014 with her movie ""Technology in Educational Development."" But it was her most recent project that catapulted her to international recognition. Released late last year, ""A Promising Africa"" (watch trailer below) is the first in an ongoing series which will profile five African nations, starting with her father's homeland of Nigeria. ""I've interviewed 14 heads of state and a few of those include the President of Tanzania, Liberia, Kenya, South Sudan, Nigeria and Cape Verde, to name a few,"" says Oduwole. ""I've also been able to interview business leaders like my friend Mr Aliko Dangote."" To date, ""A Promising Africa"" has received a limited-release on the big screen in five countries -- Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, UK and Japan. The young trailblazer, who was named by Business Insider as one of world's 100 most powerful individuals last year, delightedly recalls seeing her film on the big screen and walking the red carpet in Lagos. ""I'm hoping that when people see these documentaries they will see Africa is full of positive things -- not just the things that are on the news like war, famine, disease,"" she says. ""I want to show them there is a lot more to Africa than what we see on the news -- there's dancing, music, great culture and more."" Although she's just 12, Oduwole, who is home-schooled through an online Californian system, is already a 9th grader -- two years ahead of the rest of the kids her age. Her mother, Patricia, has a full-time job as a computer engineer, whilst her father, Ademola, has taken time off his work in the tourism sector to help organize a lot of what Zuriel and her three other siblings are doing. ""There really is a lot happening in our household but somehow we make it work,"" says Patricia Oduwole. In addition to her documentary work, Oduwole has also become something of an education advocate. She travels to different African countries and the diaspora on a regular basis to talk to students about the importance of education. So far, through her side project ""Dream Up, Speak Up, Stand Up"" she says she's had the opportunity to talk to 21,000 children in nine countries. ""Girl's education is important because on the African continent, where there are not as many resources, the boys are the first [to get an education],"" says Oduwole. ""The boys go to school and get an education while the girls stay at home. And those girls aren't educated and have fewer options in life when they get older.""

52,"Carlos Mars, 19, is facing assault and weapons charges . Police have arrested a 19-year-old student in connection with a stabbing at Morgan State University that left three football players injured. Police said Wednesday that Carlos Mars has been charged with assault and weapons charges. The stabbing happened Tuesday afternoon when a fight broke out between two groups of students at the Baltimore-based campus. Police say two men were slashed, one across the chest and one in the back, and a third student suffered abrasions. Charging documents show that a witness told investigators that Mars 'repeatedly and aggressively' stabbed another student in the chest during a fight. But Mars told investigators he 'swung his knife around in a wild manner' to keep students away from his friend, who also was involved in the fight. Police say Mars remains in jail. It was the third instance of violence on the Baltimore campus in less than a week. The players were taken to hospitals and their injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, police said. University spokesman Clint Coleman said one of the players was slashed across the chest and another was cut on the arm.

'We expect you as students to take responsibility for your own behavior and actions,' University president David Wilson told those in attendance.

Kevin Banks, vice president for student affairs, repeated that assertion. 'The stuff you've seen on TV the past few days is not Morgan State University,' Banks said. Wilson also said no text alerts were sent to students immediately after the stabbing because 'the general public was not in imminent danger because this was a fight between known parties and not a random act of violence.' But Freshman Shakia Marine, 20, who did not attend the campus meeting, said she is a little worried about the latest spate of violence. 'My godfather has concerns about me coming here,' Marine said. 'There needs to be more security guards walking around. After today, it made me feel scared. My roommate said we should get some Mace to protect ourselves.

54,"A new dating app claims to be 'putting the excitement back into dating' by pushing users' personalities ahead of their looks. Much like Tinder - the notorious dating app responsible for making 'swipe left' a cultural reference - FuzzyBanter can hook you up with people living in your area. But rather than have singles base their dating choices on potentially cringeworthy profile pictures, the app 'fuzzes' your face to let your listed interests do the matchmaking instead. New dating app FuzzyBanter blurs out profile pictures to let the listed interests and personality traits of its users become the the main attraction . All FuzzyBanter dating profile pictures are blurred to start off with (pictured right), though you can reveal what you look like further down the line. Age, height and ethnicity can still be used as search filters, to help people find their perfect match (pictured left) Claiming to 'bring courtship back to the 21st century', the app allows users to list up to ten interests when they sign up, along with a 160 character bio. You'll also need to enter your age, height, location, star sign and ethnicity, which can all be used as filters for potential dates to find what they're looking for. Once your vitals are in and your profile set up, you can search people by their proximity to you, just like on Tinder, and give anyone you like a thumbs up, or 'nudge'. If a person you've 'nudged' gives you a nudge back, congratulations, you've made a match and can now start messaging. Blending Facebook's Poke button with Tinder's swipe left or swipe right function, FuzzyBanter asks you to swipe right to 'nudge' a person you like. If they nudge you back, you have a match and can start chatting . Once you've reached the messaging stage with a potential date, this is where the fuzzy fun really begins. Though the idea behind the app is find matches based on your common interests and compatibility, singles don't have to agree to a blind date. Both participants have the option to either partially or fully reveal their profile picture, before anyone has shelled out for dinner or a drink. Found a FuzzyBanter match? Once you've started a conversation you can chose to reveal as much of your profile picture as you like, by altering the level of fuziness using the sliding scale . Stuck for words? The messaging feature in the dating app includes a long list of conversation templates, some far more flirty than others, to help even the shiest of daters get the ball rolling . Launching last night with a VIP bash in London, the app already has celebrity backing from the likes of Eastenders' Danny Dyer, actresses Lisa Faulkner and Angela Griffin, Apprentice winner Mark Wright, and TOWIE cast members Elliot Wright, Jessica Wright and James Argent. Founded by Allen James Scriven and Michael John Caine, FuzzyBanter is aimed at people aged between 18 and 45, looking for the perfect match. The app can even help you kick off the conversation if you're feeling a little shy, with a whole host of pre-written message templates. Eastenders star Danny Dyer showed his support for the new dating app, which rivals the already immensely popular Tinder, responsible for bringing 'swipe left' into common conversation . Lord Sugar's Apprentice 2014 winner Mark Wright has thrown his business initiative behind the new launch . Actress Angela Griffin was keen to share on Twitter how to app can help people find love based on more than just appearances .","New dating app FuzzyBanter offers alternative to looks-obsessed Tinder .

55,"(CNN)Incumbent Goodluck Jonathan phoned former military leader Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday to concede defeat in Nigeria's presidential elections, Buhari's party says. Jonathan acknowledged the phone call and his defeat in a written statement to his countrymen. ""I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,"" he said. The Independent National Electoral Commission is still announcing the final tally in the polls, but early numbers indicate Buhari, now the President-elect, has an overwhelming majority of votes. Buhari ruled Nigeria from late 1983 until August 1985 after ousting his predecessor in a coup. His 20-month rule was known for what he described as a ""war on indiscipline,"" a tough regime that some say was marred by human rights abuses. The 72-year-old  retired major general's experience as a military ruler has variably been viewed as a plus or minus in present-day Nigeria, where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group Boko Haram. His campaign has focused on security and ending corruption in Nigeria. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? Violent protests after elections Saturday sparked calls for calm from the two main candidates and a warning by the United States and Britain against political interference. Demonstrators fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state on Sunday as they marched to protest the elections amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation. After the protests in Rivers, Buhari's All Progressives Congress demanded the elections there be canceled. ""There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable,"" party spokesman Lai Mohammed said. But the People's Democratic Party disputed the accusation, saying the election was ""credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan."" Both candidates took to social media to call for calm. ""I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results,"" Jonathan said on his Facebook account. ""Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced,"" Buhari said on Twitter. Jonathan and  Buhari last week issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to ""free, fair and credible elections"" after their signing of  the Abuja Accord in January. In his statement Tuesday, Jonathan said; ""I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word."" He advised anyone upset with the results to follow due process and stay away from further violence. ""As I have always affirmed, nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. The unity, stability and progress of our dear country is more important than anything else,"" he said. Read more: Democracy was the real winner . More than 800 people were killed in post-election violence across Nigeria's north in 2011 after charges that those elections were illegitimate. Nigeria's vote had been scheduled for February 14, but on February 7, Nigeria's election commission announced it would be postponed for six weeks because of security concerns, with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. The controversial decision was unpopular among many Nigerians and led to widespread protests. Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram, which is waging a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of Sharia law in Nigeria. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed and two more injured in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. CNN's Christian Purefoy reported from Lagos, Nigeria, while CNN's Susannah Cullinane and Stephanie Busari wrote from London.","Incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan acknowledges defeat, says he delivered on promise of fair elections .

57,"SKYFARING . by Mark Vanhoenacker . (Chatto & Windus £16.99) Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker’s book, unwittingly, very timely indeed. When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets. Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life. But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience. Mark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job . Vanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our ‘historic relationship with aviation’. Coincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights — exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye. Vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia’s great blue heron as ‘the 747 of the swamp’ and notes how this would delight the aircraft’s chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more ‘a place’ than a conveyance. Pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the ‘frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better — everything looks better — when your feet are warm’. He writes elegantly about his pilot’s eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country. Noting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth’s surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent. But of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys. Vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And ‘meet’ really means ‘meet’: air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, ‘our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.’ Before boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there’s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as ‘Klingons’. Unsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as ‘the heavy’, one acting as ‘heavy out’, the other as ‘heavy home’. And for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters. These often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker’s home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region’s prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city’s more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek. But other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX. Vanhoenacker’s best guess is that an air-traffic controller there was a fan of Eurythmics’ singer Annie Lennox. Who would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace Mr Spock, Klingons and Annie Lennox? Skyfaring is crammed with these revelations and more, while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note. Maybe one day, Vanhoenacker hopes, wide-eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight. In the meantime, he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there, and why we should still trust the men at the controls.","The Germanwings tragedy has ignited debate about depression in pilots .

The Help to Buy Isa was unveiled by the Chancellor yesterday as a way to help thousands of young people on to the property ladder. Set to be launched by banks and building societies this Autumn, it will give a maximum bonus per saver of up to £3,000. This means that a young couple who jointly save £24,000 could get £6,000 from the Government. Scroll down for video . George Osborne announced a new first-time buyers Isa for those saving for a deposit and looking to get onto the property ladder. It will give them £50 from the Government for every £200 they put away . Groups of friends who buy together would also be able to take out one Isa each and get additional bonuses. The scheme was hailed as a massive boost for first-time buyers, amid claims it could cut the average time taken to save for a deposit by up to a year. David Hollingworth, director at brokers London & Country, said: ‘This is basically free money. ‘It will help combat the issue which really affects first-time buyers who complain that they cannot save as quick as house prices are rising. ‘It is quite a large perk the Government is paying.’ The average UK first-time buyer currently pays around £150,000 for a home, putting down an average deposit of £25,000, according to figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Set to be launched by banks and building societies this Autumn, it will give a maximum bonus per saver of up to £3,000. This means that a young couple who jointly save £24,000 could get £6,000 from the Government . In London, the typical price paid for a first home is £260,000. Last year around 25,000 first-time buyers a month made it on to the property ladder, with an average income of £38,000. However, steep rises in house prices around the country – particularly in London and the South East – mean that it is becoming increasingly difficult for many to save the deposit needed. 76,400 Employment growth in Yorkshire between 2010 and 2013 compared to 66,000 in the whole of France . 2.6% UK growth in 2014 – faster than any other advanced economy including Germany and seven times the level in France . 100,000 Fall in unemployment announced yesterday . 5.3% Expected unemployment rate this year –nearly half the eurozone’s average of 9.8 per cent . 30.94m Number in work – a record . 1.9m Number of jobs created since 2010 . 73.3% Percentage of working age people now in employment – the highest rate since records began . 80% Percentage of jobs created which are full-time . 80% Percentage of jobs created which are skilled . 1,000 Number of jobs created every day . £900 The average amount that households are better off by, compared to 2010 . 0.2% Projected inflation rate this year . £1,000 Interest people will now be able to earn on their savings tax-free . £50 Top-up given to the savings of first-time buyers by the Government for every £200 they save in a new Help to Buy Isa . £35bn Cut in Government interest payments on the national debt thanks to low inflation rate . £5.2bn Projected size of budget surplus in 2018/19 . 71.6% Debt as a share of GDP in 2019/20, down from 80.3% last year . £13bn Expected proceeds from the sale of Government assets in Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley . The Government already has a number of initiatives aimed at those trying to buy their first property. The original Help to Buy scheme, which has proved extremely popular, allows people to buy a home worth up to £600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit. The Government provides them with a loan – which is initially interest-free – to make up the rest of the down payment. Around 45,000 buyers have benefited from the scheme so far. The new Isa is the latest attempt by the Government to help first-time buyers. The accounts will work like a traditional Isa, with interest paid out by banks and building societies tax-free. They will be available to new account-holders for four years – but once opened there is no limit on how long someone can save for. Savers can make an initial deposit of £1,000 when they open the Isa, but after this can only pay in a maximum of £200 a month. A £50 bonus is then added by the Treasury. The minimum bonus size is £400, and the maximum is £3,000 – which would be payable on a balance of £12,000. The bonus is only paid out when someone buys their first home, and only applies to properties worth up to £450,000 in London and £250,000 elsewhere in the UK. Savers must be 16 or over to open a Help to Buy Isa. They are individual accounts, meaning a group of four friends buying a home together could benefit from a total of £12,000 in Government bonuses. Official figures suggest around £2billion could be paid out in bonuses between now and 2020. Britain’s biggest bank, Lloyds Banking Group, estimated the bonus payouts could slash the average time it takes a first-time buyer to save a 5 per cent deposit from 37 months to 27. Stephen Noakes, the bank’s managing director of retail products, said: ‘We believe this provides a genuine solution to the challenge of raising a deposit. We know that this is the key barrier when trying to buy a first home. ‘This rewards positive savings behaviour and makes a real difference in helping young people get on to the property ladder faster.’ 'Thrilled': David and Laura Picken want to buy their first home and start a family so the Government's new Help To Buy Isa will help them get on the property ladder . Young couple Laura and David Picken are renting a home while they save for a deposit, and were ‘thrilled’ to hear of the Government’s Help To Buy Isa. The new measure, designed to help first-time buyers, will see the Government contribute £50 for every £200 saved. The pair are currently paying £570 a month in rent on a three-bedroom terraced house in Liverpool, but would like to buy a home of their own with a garden so they can start a family. Mrs Picken, 27, takes home £28,000 a year as a violinist while her husband, 26, works in hospitality earning £11,000. They have so far managed to save £2,000 towards a house deposit in Isas with the Royal Bank of Scotland at an interest rate of 0.5 per cent. As Mrs Picken is self-employed, her income varies from month to month and she finds it difficult to put money aside regularly. She hopes the Help to Buy Isa will speed up the couple’s saving. The maximum Government bonus is £3,000 per person, so they could get £6,000 between them from the State. Mrs Picken said: ‘This Help To Buy Isa is going to make a huge difference to us because we’ll be able to save up and get on the property ladder faster. ‘The significance of something like this is monumental for us because it could halve the time it takes us to put enough aside for a deposit. This will speed up our lives, it’s absolutely brilliant and I’m thrilled.’","New first-time buyers' Isa will help thousands  get on to the property ladder .

63,"Burnley manager Sean Dyche has attempted to protect out-of-sorts striker Danny Ings by calling on the rest of his team-mates to share the goalscoring burden to keep the team in the Premier League. Ings, strongly linked with a move to Manchester United or Liverpool when his contract at Turf Moor runs out in the summer, hasn't scored since February 11 — a run of eight matches — and missed his side's best chance in Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Everton that left Burnley bottom. As a team, they have scored just one goal in their last seven matches and while Dyche needs 23-year-old Ings to rediscover his mojo quickly, starting with the critical home game against relegation rivals Leicester City, he insists it's unfair to pin the club's survival hopes on one man. Burnley striker Danny Ings is struggling for form at the moment and hasn't scored since February 11 . Everton full-back Seamus Coleman (right) comes forward with the ball as Ings (left) gives chase on Saturday . Ings runs away in celebration after scoring for Burnley against Manchester United at Old Trafford in February . Burnley manager Sean Dyche insists that the rest of his players must help to relieve the pressure on Ings . 'Yes, Danny needs to find his goal touch but it's not just him. You want everyone and anyone to score. Boydy (George Boyde) has got goals, Scott Arfield's chipped in. David Jones had a great chance against Everton so the whole team has to step up to the plate. 'I'd be questioning us more if we weren't creating chances but we have been creating. It's rare at this level that you see a whole plethora of chances, say 15 or 20 like you see in other leagues, so when your chances come you have to take them.' Ings was mentioned in the same breath as Harry Kane not so long ago but you could see a lack of confidence as he misdirected a header from a Kieran Trippier cross in the closing minutes. It is 43 months since Everton last lost a 3pm Saturday home game, a 1-0 defeat against QPR which marked Tony Fernandes' first match in charge as the visitors' new owner. Everton won the game with a first-half goal from Kevin Mirallas who was later fortunate not to become the second player to be dismissed by referee Mike Jones when he caught Boyd on the shin. Burnley's Ashley Barnes had earlier been sent off for two bookable challenges, a decision Dyche had no complaints about. Everton's stand-out performer was winger Aaron Lennon who has impressed since a January loan move from Tottenham. Even so, manager Roberto Martinez insists there are no plans at this stage to sign him on a permanent basis. 'With all honesty, we are not going to think about that situation until the season is over,' said Martinez. 'When you have a loan player it is always a three-way conversation. The player is the first one that needs to make a decision and the parent club has a big say. I've never been worried about what is going to happen at the end of it. 'You see sometimes when you make loan moves permanent, they don't work out. Then sometimes it is the opposite, you sign a loan player and he becomes the best player you could ever sign because you know him and they know the way the team works.' Everton's young England player Ross Barkley suffered the indignity of missing an early penalty when he stepped up instead of Leighton Baines, whose conversion rate in the Premier League is 15 from 16. Even so, Martinez insists he will continue to leave it to the players to decide who takes penalties if the regular taker Romelu Lukaku isn't on the pitch. Everton winger Kevin Mirallas scores his side's winning goal against Burnley at Goodison Park on Saturday .

The League One strugglers sacked Shaun Derry and assistant Greg Abbott on Monday as they look to stop their slide.

Notts County  sacked manager Shaun Derry following their poor recent run of results . How the bottom of League One is shaping up . Former Nottingham Forest boss Paul Hart is the early favourite to replace Derry but Shan, 35, is regarded as one of the game's brightest up and coming coaches. He is credited with helping bring through Albion prospects such as Saido Berahino, Iasiah Brown, Chris Wood, George Thorne and Yan Dhanda who was snapped up from Albion's academy by Liverpool. He worked with FA director of elite development Dan Ashworth and has progressed through the coaching ranks since moving to the Hawthorns as U11s coach in 2006. He was promoted from his role at U18 development coach last summer with Albion technical director Terry Burton saying: 'James was the obvious choice to fill the role. He knows the players well having worked with them and helped progress them over the years.'

65,"A cheating wife shot dead her husband so that she could be with her lover, police have said. Cindy Reese, 40, and her boyfriend Jeffery Brown, 36, have been charged with murder nearly a month after Michael Earl Reese, 40, was found killed in the couple's kitchen in Morris, Alabama. Cindy Reese had called Morris police at 8pm on February 18 to say that she had arrived home and found the house in disarray, indicating there had been a robbery, AL.com reported. But when police arrived and checked the home on Banks Street, they found Mr Reese fatally shot in the head. Arrested: Cindy Reese, 40, and Jeffery Brown, 36, were arrested on Wednesday for the murder of Reese's husband at their Alabama home last month. Police say the pair plotted the murder so they could be together . The department called the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office for help investigating a homicide, and detectives found that there were no signs of forced entry at the home and nothing was missing. The day after the murder, Jefferson County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian said it was unusual for a burglary to happen that time of night and there was 'a good possibility that was staged', WSFA reported. He said that the killing did not appear random and that the victim likely knew his killer. Investigators then learned that Cindy Reese, who married her husband in 2009, had been having an affair with Brown. Property records indicate that Brown lives with a woman. Killed: Mrs Reese, pictured with her husband Michael Reese on their wedding day in 2009, called authorities to her home on February 18 saying that it was in disarray. Officers searched the house and found his body . Murdered: Detectives said they found no signs of a forced break in or anything missing at the home when they discovered Mr Reese's body. Investigators later discovered Mrs Reese was having an affair . The duo had plotted to kill Mr Reese so that they could be together, Chief Deputy Randy Christian of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office told AL.com. He said the murder was the result of 'dark hearts, stupidity and extreme selfishness'. 'I think we all understand matters of the heart and the ups, downs, ebbs and flows of relationships,' Christian said. 'What we can't understand and will never understand is someone getting so twisted, dark and lost that they believe cold-blooded murder is the answer. Brown and Reese were taken into custody on Wednesday as he dropped her off following a lunch date, police said, and both are being held on $100,000 bail. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office announced the murder charges on Wednesday.

69,"Leeds did it under Don Revie; Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United side did it; Atletico Madrid under Diego Simeone do it. Many great sides have hounded and harassed referees over the years. It’s a characteristic at times of their determination to win and their unity. So when Chelsea surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off on Wednesday it wasn’t something new, or a modern phenomenon that has been creeping up on us. It has nothing to do with foreign players and managers coming into the game. It’s been a part of English football for years. Having said that, now is the time to draw a line and punish teams that overstep the mark in this way, as I believe Chelsea did on Wednesday and I think it could be done with a simple amendment to the rules. Almost all the Chelsea squad surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers after an incident at Stamford Bridge . If a referee feels that he is being aggressively hounded by a group of players he should have the power to reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way. So on Wednesday night, he could still have sent off Ibrahimovic if he really felt it was a red card offence but Chelsea would have lost the advantage of a free kick. It wouldn’t immediately cut out hounding refs but it would be a nudge in the right direction. Behaviour only changes if managers are encouraged to discipline their players. At the moment, it’s worthwhile clamouring round a referee to get a decision, so few coaches would discourage their players from doing so. However, if you felt that by hounding the referee, your team might lose a potential goal-scoring opportunity, because you would miss out on a free kick on the edge of the box, managers would soon start telling their players to exercise more restraint. And over-zealous appealing for penalties would stop pretty quickly. Imagine losing the chance to take a penalty kick because you had surrounded the referee. The manager would be furious. Referees are only human. Kuipers might have looked at the Ibrahimovic tackle and thought it was a 50-50 decision. But when you have 38,000 people screaming for the red card and then you have a group of players around demanding it too, all of that activity around him might make him feel it’s a 90 per cent decision. This tackle from PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic sparked a furious reaction from Chelsea players . The Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers at Stamford Bridge as he brandishes the red card . Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half . This would only be a small change in the rules but I believe it would make a massive change in behaviour over time. Certainly managers wouldn’t encourage their team to attempt to influence the referee in that way anymore because there would be an immediate punishment which could cost the team. It gives the referee a little bit more power and it would act as powerful disincentive. You could also apply the same rule of reversing the free kick if a player showed an imaginary card, trying to get an opponent booked or sent off. That would soon end what is an unsavoury practice. Another area which needs looking at is when a player marches towards a referee in an aggressive manner, forcing the referee to back off. It’s natural for players to complain when they feel aggrieved and when emotions are running high. But what is important is that we establish that exclusion zone around the referee where players won’t encroach. If someone is to complain, they can do so backing away from the referee, getting into position, not moving towards him. And if someone does need to go to referee, it should only be the captain. And when complaining they should show some respect for the personal space of the referee. John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge . Football is a physical game and that is part of its spectacle. I’ve no desire to curb the aggression of players when it’s directed in the right way. But referees need to be protected and their personal space needs to be almost sacrosanct. It’s important to draw a line and clearly state what is and isn’t acceptable. WHEN FRIDAY COMES, ENGLISH TEAMS CAN FEEL BENEFIT IN EUROPE . It has been an awful few weeks for English teams in Europe with only Everton thriving in the Europa League. Given the competitiveness of the Premier League you would imagine that our teams would be more than ready for this stage of the Champions League and Europa League, when the competitions step up a level. But the reverse seems to happening. The sheer competitiveness of the Premier League is leaving us short in these difficult games. Not only do we tend to have four teams who believe they can win the title, which is not the case in most of Europe’s other major leagues, but there is an increased level of intensity about all our games. Everton are progressing well in the Europa League as other English sides continue to struggle in Europe . Having played in France, I know that for Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille and Lyon there will only be a handful of games for which they need to be at their best. It’s not that it’s easy but going to the smaller French teams is not like going to Turf Moor to play Burnley or Loftus Road to play QPR, where the crowd is right on top of you and everyone is expecting the home side to put one over Chelsea or Manchester United. That’s not the case in France, and I’m not sure it is in Italy or Spain. Obviously Bayern Munich are utterly dominant in Germany at the moment, so there aren’t that many games where they need to be at the top level. Don’t forget that while our teams were playing five games in two weeks over Christmas, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke were on a 40-day break. Arsenal endured a torrid Champions League 3-0 defeat against Monaco late last month . And while the Christmas break isn’t as long in France, Italy and Spain, it allows their players to relax get a couple of weeks in the sun. It’s ironic that the intensity and competitiveness of the Premier League, which is what has made it so successful, might now be damaging our performance in Europe and by extension damaging it’s reputation. However, there is an opportunity now to help English team in the Champions League. Jose Mourinho has long drawn attention to Spanish teams playing games on a Friday night if they have a Tuesday night Champions League game. The new £5.1billion TV deal — a mark of how popular the Premier League is — has provision for some Friday night games. The Premier League and TV companies should be looking at those Friday night games to see whether they can schedule teams competing in the Champions League. We need to give our teams every chance we can. After all, if Premier League clubs consistently fail in Europe, global audiences will begin to question just how good these clubs really are. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers' side crashed of the Europa League to Besiktas in late February . GREAT TO LOOK BACK AT MY CAREER . I was really honoured a few months ago when Sky Sports asked if I would be the subject of a documentary covering my life in football. The result will be shown tonight on Sky Sports 1 and it’s been a trip down memory lane for me and a chance to reflect on my career. There are one or two things I hadn’t remembered, like the post-match interview I did after scoring on my league debut as an 18-year-old against Stoke in 1976. The collars on the shirt I was wearing — oh my word! They look like something Barry White might have turned down as excessive. Glenn Hoddle volleys in for Tottenham against Manchester United in 1979, his favourite goal he scored . And I’m pleased to say my Top of the Pops appearance singing Diamond Lights gets an outing — not that any of the musicians will be. It also gave me a chance to take another look at my favourite goal, the volley I scored for Tottenham against Manchester United from just inside the box in 1979. I’ve never taken drugs in my life but the feeling I had that day, with the adrenalin pumping through my body after scoring, is how I imagine it feels. I hope people enjoy watching the film as much as I did making it.

More than 60 of the beautiful creatures decided to make use of the resort's pool, taking turns to drink from it three at a time. Rangers and visitors at the resort were treated to a very up-close view of the wild animals as specialist guide Mark Lautenbach snapped these amazing pictures. Scroll down for video . Guests got more than they had paid for when a herd of 60 elephants appeared out of the wild to drink from a private swimming pool . The pool is part of The Homestead, a resort on the exclusive Phinda Private Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa . Lautenbach, 30, who took the pictures on March 3, has been a guide at the resort for the past eight years. He said that the elephants had initially arrived to use a nearby waterhole, but soon turned their attention to the lodge. 'This morning after a rather quiet game drive I had breakfast with the guests and headed off to a rangers meeting in the south of the reserve,' he wrote online. 'The lodge I work at - The Homestead - has a beautiful open plan deck, small gym with two rooms on either side and a pool on the deck overlooking a small waterhole. 'While I was away something spectacular occurred and I was fortunate enough to return just in time to get some photos.' Although there is thick woodland surrounding the waterhole, several herds emerged to go to a nearby waterhole - which was all mud . The elephants had initially arrived to use a nearby waterhole, but soon turned their attention to the lodge and its sprawling pool . 'The view from the lodge is rather open with thick woodland beyond the waterhole, but at around 11 o'clock that morning a herd of elephants emerged from the woodlands and came to drink at the waterhole - a usual but privileged site for guests at Homestead,' he added. 'What we didn't expect was that right behind them another herd arrived, and then another and then another. 'They all went to the small waterhole which had now been depleted at a rapid rate and found there to be just mud. Elephants can drink up to 100 litres of water a day on average and its estimated that these herds drank about 6,000 litres in one sitting . 'Instead of moving off to find water elsewhere, they had a mud wallow then turned their attention to the lodge swimming pool. 'By the time I had arrived there were over 60 elephants all around the lodge drinking from the swimming pool two or three at a time. 'They did not have the decency to drink first before wallowing in the mud, turning the water muddy brown before finishing over half the pool water.' The herd spent over three hours drinking, wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush . Experienced guide Mark Lautenbach who has worked on the reserve for eight years, was on hand to photograph the amazing sight . 'Elephants can drink up to 100 litres of water a day on average,' Lautenbach explained. 'With easily over 60 elephants all helping themselves to the fresh blue waters of Homestead pool, they must have dank over 6,000 litres of water in one sitting.' Apparently, the elephant herds spent around three hours drinking, wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush. He said: 'I cannot say it was as if they were never here. 'It looked like a Thailand beach party after a full moon with piles of stinky, half-digested dung littered all over the front of the lodge and a few bucket scoops of dirty mud water at the bottom of the pool. 'The deck was splattered with mud and the grass flattened to the ground.'","Several herds of elephants made use of an exclusive resort pool on the Phinda Private Game Reserve .

76,"Ben Moynihan, 18, was found guilty of attempted murder after stabbing the three women then taunting police with two notes in which he boasted how he loved to smell his victims' flesh . A teenager who wrote notes to police asking them to catch him has been jailed for 21 years - for the attempted murder of three women he stabbed because he was unable to lose his virginity. Ben Moynihan, who is now 18, of Portsmouth, Hampshire, was found guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court of the three charges following a week-long trial. The judge, Mr Justice Jay, said Moynihan suffered from an autism spectrum disorder and had a 'gross lack of empathy'. Sentencing Moynihan, whom he described as 'dangerous', the judge told him: 'The offences were planned and premeditated. 'The contents of your computers were as chilling as they were disturbing.' The judge issued an extended licence of five years to be served on completion of the sentence and ordered the defendant to begin his prison term in a young offenders institution. He also ordered a £20 victim surcharge to be paid. The teenager, who was 17 at the time of the attacks, stabbed the three women, aged 20, 45 and 67, with a 4.5-inch kitchen knife, aiming for their hearts, as they walked alone in Portsmouth in June and July last year. To do so, he carried a steak knife on the streets of his home city up to ten times last summer before his arrest on July 13. When he was eventually caught, police body-worn footage revealed him saying: 'You was lucky, I was hunting my fourth victim.' And before carrying his crimes, he researched serial killers including Moors murderer Ian Brady, the Muswell Hill murderer Dennis Nilsen and American Jeffrey Dahmer. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said Moynihan, who called himself the 'unhappy geezer', left two letters for police confessing to his crimes in which he stated that 'all women need to die' and that he liked to smell the 'flesh he had ripped out'. The letter, left on a police van, said: 'All women needs to die and hopefully next time I can gouge their eyeballs out. 'Every time I stab someone I run home and I like to smell the flesh I ripped out. Come and arrest me for God sake before I hunt for my fourth victim.' In Moynihan's first letter to police (pictured) he labelled himself 'the unhappy geezer' and claimed to roam the streets 'hungry for blood and pain' His second letter was less cryptic - he attached a photo of himself which subsequently led to his arrest . At the bottom of the letter, Moynihan included a photograph of himself. He was arrested when police officers recognised him in the street from the picture and detained him. Another letter had a symbol from the Tomb Raider game on it. It said: 'When women won't talk to you it's heartbreaking, why are they fussy with men nowadays.' It continued: 'I roam these streets, hungry for blood and pain, I be greeted with attack, attack, attack, attack, dead, jolly good!' In a video found on his laptop, Moynihan had filmed himself saying: 'I think every girl is a type of s***, they are fussy with men nowadays, they do not give boys like us a chance. 'I am still a virgin, everyone is losing it before me, that's why you are my chosen target. I just can't live in this flat, I have no future here. So women, tell me how we should do this.' Ms Maylin said he also kept what he called a 'diary of evil' which detailed the attacks, as well as a document listing his dreams, which included descriptions of violence against women and of killing. A police officer stands guard at the scene of one of Moynihan's stabbings in July last year . Ms Maylin added: 'Ben Moynihan had an incomprehensible fascination for killing and he would compare himself to serial killers.' In a victim impact statement, the 20-year-old victim said: 'In the days and weeks immediately after the attack, I felt very scared. I couldn't go out on my own. I just wanted to stay inside. 'I often get flashbacks of that dreadful night and when I'm walking alone I have to keep looking back behind me just in case someone is there. I don't trust strangers, I often look at where their hands are placed.' The 67-year-old woman said in her statement: 'I used to be a confident public speaker as part of my work but I feel I will never be able to do this again. 'My life was completely turned upside down, I did not ask for this change, it was forced upon me by my attacker.' In mitigation, Robert Bryan described Moynihan as a 'young impressionable man' and pointed out that none of the injuries were life threatening injuries despite what he said in his videos. Another stabbing occurred in Cosham, Portsmouth. Pictured are forensics officers searching the scene . Police comb through woodland in Hilsea, Portsmouth, following Moynihan's June stabbing . Police launched a public appeal in the wake of the stabbings in an attempt to hunt down Moynihan . Mr Bryan said: 'When considering his behaviour he, having learnt that on the first occasion there were no life threatening injuries, at no stage thereafter did he increase the ferocity of his attacks or attempt to attack in some other way. 'He had the intent but it may be that his heart wasn't quite into it. He didn't carry out any of the matters the he set out to do in his video. 'They were horrific to the victims but in fact he didn't go further that one stab as he ran past them which only caused superficial injuries.' Mr Bryan also pointed out Moynihan assisted police with a photograph of himself and approached them to say he was the man they were looking for. Moynihan, wearing a white long sleeved shirt with black suit trousers, showed no emotion as he was lead from the dock by two security guards.","Ben Moynihan, 18, was found guilty of attempted murder of three women .

77,"His nine-year career at Arsenal has been an emotional and physical roller coaster.

Comparisons were already drawn to club legend and former captain Patrick Vieira because of his height, intensity and technique on the ball. 'Diaby is a bit more offensive than Vieira but when he plays a more defensive role he is very similar,' Wenger said. He started off well, scoring his first goal for the Gunners in April against Aston Villa, but his debut half-season in north London ended in despair. Diaby was the victim of an 'assassins tackle' from Sunderland youngster Dan Smith - according to Wenger - his sickening scream as he fractured his ankle at the Stadium of Light must still be heard by the boss.

A bandaged Diaby under pressure from Manchester City's Michael Ball (right) during Arsenal's 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in the league in April 2007 . Arsenal have played in 350 league games since About Diaby signed. He has featured in 124 of them or 35%, one every 15.7 days. League games by season: 2005/06: 12, 2006-07: 12, 2007-08: 15, 2008-09: 24, 2009-10: 29, 2010/11: 16, 2011-12: 4, 2012-13 11, 2013-14 1, 2014-15: 0 . Put simply, the 28-year-old has never recovered. Whether it be a calf muscle or a hamstring, an abdominal strain or a cruciate ligament, Diaby's talent looks set to be wasted. He has clocked up 42 injuries during his Arsenal career, according to data from physioroom, averaging a new setback every 80 days. The Gunners have played 350 league games since his arrival but Diaby has featured in just 35 per cent of them. Despite his struggles, his almost constant spell on the sidelines hasn't been short of its positive moments. In early 2012 Diaby came back into the Arsenal team to feature alongside Mikel Arteta and Santi Cazorla and impressed, even scoring on his return to the French national team. Wenger heralded his fellow countryman as a holding midfielder when he made his one and only performance this season, a slack display against Southampton in a Capital One Cup defeat. Diaby is embraced by team-mates Eduardo (left) and Diarra (centre) during Arsenal's 3-2 win at Blackburn Rovers during the Carling Cup quarter-final in December 2007 .

Diaby scores past AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Sergio Romero during the Champions League Group H clash at the Emirates Stadium in November 2009 . The Arsenal midfielder scores a header past Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina in February 2010 . As recently as November, the Gunners' boss was insistent that Diaby would be offered his new contract if he were to prove his health. 'If he comes back, I will keep him. I always believed in him. In football, the most important thing is health.' But Diaby hasn't come close to featuring since, and given the wealth of midfield options Wenger has available it is extremely unlikely he will ever don the Arsenal shirt again, even if he were to return to fitness. He is the second longest-serving player at the club behind Theo Walcott, and is a much-loved figure in the dressing room. His emotional pull remains strong with the fans, who would love for him to be the midfield destroyer and box-to-box runner he has shown he can be. Diaby vies for the ball with Barcelona star Lionel Messi during the Champions League quarter-final at the Emirates Stadium in March 2010 . Diaby battles with Liverpool midfielder Joe Cole (left) during a 1-1 draw at Anfield in August 2010 . Diaby appeared on the final day of last season for Arsenal away at Norwich in his most recent Premier League appearance for the club. It was also his only appearance last season . However, this isn't a perfect world and head must rule over heart, especially at a club vying for the top places. Diaby has played one Premier League game in his last two years, and Arsenal have backed the player admirably. But as the midfielder looks to get back to full strength once again, wherever that may be, this quote by Vieira should not be forgotten. 'If he could have improved constantly, he would have reached an exceptional level. About his potential, he is better than me, better on a technical level, better dribbler, and better scorer too.'

84,"Prosecutors in the capital murder trial of an Alabama woman charged in the death of her granddaughter compared her to a drill sergeant for forcing the 9-year-old girl to run nonstop for three hours in opening statements today. Joyce Garrard is accused of punishing 9-year-old Savannah Hardin for lying about eating candy on the school bus by making her run while carrying sticks and firewood at the family's home in Etowah County in 2012. Garrard, 49, could face the death penalty or life without parole if convicted. Scroll down for video . Accused: Joyce Hardin Garrad, who is accused of capital murder, is pictured entering an Alabama courtroom today dressed in a pale green jacket and a striped blouse, with a heart-shaped pendant around her neck . Victim: Garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter, Savannah Hardin (pictured left and right), nine, to run to her death at her home in Etowah County in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates . Assistant district attorney Marcus Reid said during opening statements in a standing-room-only courtroom that jurors would hear from neighbors who say they heard and saw what happened to Savannah the day she died. Defense attorney Dani Bone tried to raise doubt about medical evidence in the case by showing jurors a version of the indictment, which mentioned severe dehydration and seizures. However, Bone said Savannah died because of a fatally low sodium level. He said the evidence will show the girl had too much water in her system, not that she was dehydrated. Bone told jurors that prosecutors ‘have oversold their case to the world.’ ‘They're trying to hoodwink you with junk science,’ he said. ‘Make them prove their case.’ According to prosecutors, neighbors said Garrard yelled at the girl as she ran, forcing her to continue ‘like some kind of drill sergeant.’ At one point, a neighbor saw the girl vomiting on her hands and knees, begging to stop, Reid said. When paramedics arrived, they found Savannah on the ground, ‘freezing cold to the touch,’ her clothes and shoes soaking wet, Reid said. Garrard never told the medics that the girl had been running; she said only that the girl collapsed in the yard. The 9-year-old was rushed to a Birmingham hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium, a condition common in marathon runners. Savannah wasn't supposed to eat chocolates because she was on medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had a bladder problem, but she had eaten candy on the school bus the day before she died. Garrard was angry that Savannah ate the candy – ‘but she was more upset about the lie,’ Reid said. Mother and daughter: Savannah (pictured with her mother in a Facebook photo) eventually collapsed and started fitting. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium . Arrests: Garrard (pictured, left, in her police mugshot) was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin (right). The former's trial begins today . Surveillance video from a school bus shown to a jury showed Garrard talking with the bus driver, Raenna Holmes, about Savannah taking candy without paying from another student who was selling it. Garrard told Holmes: ‘She's going to run until I tell her to stop. She's gonna learn.’ The women then talk about a bladder condition the girl had and a procedure she had related to that condition. The driver then asks, ‘Is she OK?"" Garrard replies: ‘She might be when I get about four more bottles of water in her.’ Garrard said Savannah was 'in double trouble' because she took the candy without paying and because she lied about it. Holmes said in court that she saw the girl picking up sticks in the yard but did not see her running. ‘I feel partly responsible. I should have paid for those candy bars,’ Holmes said. Opening statements followed a jury selection process that lasted nearly three weeks. The judge in the case has refused the defense's request to move the trial to a venue where it less well known. This morning, Garrard was seen entering a county courtroom dressed in a pale green jacket and a striped blouse, with a heart-shaped pendant around her neck. Around 15 family members watched as the defendant was led in handcuffs to her seat at the Etowah County Courthouse. The trial is expected to last a week. Scene: Gerrard allegedly made her granddaughter carry sticks of wood as she ran to her death at her home (pictured). But defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third-grader's death was not Gerrard's fault . Run to death: Savannah (pictured) suffered from unspecified medical issues that resulted in frequent doctors visits, court documents state. Defense attorneys have said it was her medical condition that caused her death . Security is tight for the start of Garrad's trial. Etowah County deputies were pictured using a metal detector to screen anyone entering the courtroom today, while all cellphones have been banned. This afternoon, prosecutors will put forward their allegations against Garrard, who was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside . Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin, is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl's death. Authorities said she failed to intervene while the older woman forced the girl to run.

85,"Worried: Alice Dreger attended the class at East Lansing High School after her son asked her to sit in on it so she could hear what was going on first hand . An outraged mom live tweeted her son's sex education class after becoming outraged by its abstinence only stance. Author Alice Dreger took to Twitter to express her horror at what she heard at East Lansing High School, in Michigan, when she sat in on a lesson earlier this week. Ms Dreger, a respected professor, began furiously tweeting out the contents of the lesson - which was filled with horror stories about what happened to people who have pre-marital sex. According to the 45 tweets sent by Ms Dreger during the lesson, stories included people who lost all their friends when they became pregnant, people who fell into comas for 11 years after taking drugs and high school dropouts. 'The whole lesson here is ""sex is part of a terrible lifestyle. Drugs, unemployment, failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster"",' tweeted Ms Dreger. She added: 'I feel like raising my hand and saying ""Can I tell my sexual history, which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage?""' Ms Dreger also complained of the incorrect information being handed to the students, who are freshmen in high school, by the teacher, who did not normally work at the school. At one point, paper babies were handed around the class to show how 'easily' condoms fail: the teacher claimed they were ineffective one in six times. ""We are going to roll this dice eight times,' Ms Dreger reported the teacher as saying. 'Every time your number comes up, in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby.' In fact, according to the NHS, just two in 100 women will get pregnant a year when people use condoms correctly. Outrage: Ms Dreger's tweets, above, show just how cross she got during the class earlier this week . Untrue: The school has denied it only teaches abstinence, saying it just happened to be that day's lesson . The tweets went viral, with people across the world getting involved with the debate over sex education. But the school has denied it only teaches abstinence - saying it was just that day's lecture which focused on the subject. 'Abstinence-based instruction teaches that abstinence is the only way to be completely safe, but the curriculum also reviews contraception choices. This parent attended on a day where abstinence was being taught,' high school principal Coby Fletcher said in the statement released to The Lansing State Journal. The school has taken no direct action against Ms Dreger for the tweets. They have, however, banned her from the premises - apart from her son's events - for swearing at the end of the lesson. @alicedreger: The kid has invited me to his health class on sex ed to see how bad it is, so I'm going. But hands over my mouth means I can't live-tweet it . @alicedreger: Uh oh. They stuck me in the corner with my computer and there is wifi....so I can live tweet this. We still pledge loyalty to the flag, huh? @alicedreger: I can't stand this. They're teaching ""abstinence stories"" that worked and non-abstinence"" stories that ""led to consequences."" @alicedreger: The visitor-teacher is telling my kid abstinence education reduces premarital sex.

Tore their family apart."" FFS. Welcome to sex ed. @alicedreger: This whole story of OD's, people in prison, out-of-marriage pregnancies is ironically a story of this guy's resilience and normalcy. @alicedreger: ""I have a daughter whose 21 and I would go absolutely nuts if I knew she ever let a stranger into her house."" @alicedreger: ""I finally met a great girl who was brought up in abstinence, and her life was so much better. I put her on a pedestal above everyone else."" @alicedreger: ""I liked her so much [I so wanted to **** her] I decided to change my lifestyle and go with abstinence [until I could F*** her]."" @alicedreger: ""Two years after we started dating I asked her to marry me and we're 8 years married."" And I'll bet yer f****, aren't ya! @alicedreger: ""We're not saying having sex is a bad thing. My story I can say having sex was a bad thing for me because I craved it."" @alicedreger: ""You'll find a good girl. If you find one that says 'no,' that's the one you want."" HE ACTUALLY JUST SAID THAT. @alicedreger: ""We can look up things on the internet but until you live that lifestyle you won't see it the same."" The whole talk is ""lifestyle."" @alicedreger: Now the woman is up. ""Sometimes condoms fail."" @alicedreger: She says ""it is absolutely better to use something than nothing"" in terms of birth control. ""But it can fail."" @alicedreger: ""It takes only 1 sperm to fertilize an egg. It takes only 1 time having sex to get pregnant."" Yet she's not suggesting oral or a***. @alicedreger: She's now telling story of condom box in which EVERY SINGLE CONDOM HAD A HOLE. @alicedreger: She says per the FDA 1 out of every 400 boxes of condom can be totally defective. ""You might get that 400th box."" BE AFRAID! @alicedreger: About 18% chance a condom will fail, she says. @alicedreger: ""On average 1 out of 6 times there is a mishap with a condom."" ""Every day in US 1600+ teen pregnancies."" Lesson: condoms fail? WTF? @alicedreger: Condoms. They fail. You get pregnant. Your friends leave you. You drop out of school. Your kids end up in the army. @alicedreger: ""We are going to roll this dice 8 times. Every time your number comes up, in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby."" J****!!! @alicedreger: Paper babies are being handed out to EVERYONE. They have ALL HAD CONDOM FAILURE AND THE WHOLE CLASS IS PREGNANT. @alicedreger: ""You have to have a baby!"" There are apparently no scissors in the room for paper abortions. @alicedreger: ""I'm going to collect the babies that you don't want.

Pierre Fulton was in the passenger seat when Officer Michael Slager pulled them over for a broken tail light. When Scott fled, Fulton and another officer stood by the Mercedes watching in shock as Slager chased him into a park and shot him dead. Now, as Slager faces murder charges and national scrutiny, Fulton's attorney has released a statement. Warning: Graphic Content Below . Scroll down for audio and video . 'He didn't deserve to die': Pierre Fulton, who was in the car with Walter Scott when Officer Michael Slager pulled them over for a broken tail light, has broken his silence. He said he does not know why Scott ran . 'Walter was a dear friend and I miss him every day. 'Over the past five years he helped me to become a better man and showed me the value of hard work. 'I'll never know why he ran, but I know he didn't deserve to die. Please keep Walter and his family in your prayers and respect my privacy moving forward.' His words on Monday night came as audio surfaced of Officer Slager laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the deadly shooting in South Carolina on April 5. Slager, 33, can be heard chuckling nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5. The dashcam footage showing Scott, 50, a Coast Guard veteran, being pulled over for a broken tail light just minutes before Slager shot him, was released to the media on Thursday. The camera continued to record for another hour and a recording of the audio feed, including the conversation between Slager and a senior officer, was obtained by The Guardian. 'By the time you get home, it would probably be a good idea to kind of jot down your thoughts on what happened,' the senior officer said. 'You know, once the adrenaline quits pumping.' 'It's pumping,' Slager said, laughing. The senior officer replied: 'Oh yeah. Oh yeah.' The senior officer told Slager during the conversation to go home and relax, assuring him that he would not have to answer questions about the shooting for days. Scott was shot five times in the back as he ran away from the traffic stop. The father of four's death has sparked a nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after a witness published video contradicting the police account of the event. Slager can be heard laughing nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5 . Slager, 33, who is white, said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott, who is black, during a confrontation over his Taser, but video shows the civilian running away before being shot. The dashcam also recorded a cellphone call that Slager received about five minutes before his conversation with the senior officer. 'Hey. Hey, everything's OK, OK?' Slager said, after an iPhone ringtone was heard. Slager then appears to say: 'He grabbed my taser, yeah. Yeah, he was running from me.' His wife, Jamie, is eight months pregnant with their first child. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police and charged with murder on Tuesday. A group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting to be arrested. National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report. The National Bar Association is calling for North Chareston officer Clarence Habersham, 37 (right) to be arrested for falsifying a report about the actions of  Michael Slager, 33 (left), during the death of Walter Scott . Habersham (right) was the second office to arrive at the body of Scott, 50, and did not report Slager's actions leading up to the shooting . Habersham, who approached the body after Slager went to go grab the Taser that fell, can be seen examining Scott. Slager then drops the Taser next to the dead body in the presence of Habersham. Habersham then used his radio to report that Scott had gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. However, the black officer gave a two-sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body, which no one in the video does. Officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body. Sergeant James Gann wrote in his report that he helped Habersham administer first aid and CPR. On April 4, 2015 I Officer Habersham responded to the empty Lot behind Mega Pawn in reference to the above incident. I (Habersham) attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to take to get to the victim faster. Video released after Slager's account into the death shows Scott (left) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot. Mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran (right) over the past week . Slager said after the incident that he 'felt threatened' by Scott, though video shot by Feidin Santana contradicts his report . Feidin Santana, who filmed a widely circulated video of the incident, said he did not any officers giving Scott CPR. The National Bar Association, the country's oldest group of black lawyers, said that Habersham 'deliberately left material facts out of his report' and left it 'incomplete'. The group said it was 'outraged' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report. Police are interviewing all officers involved, a police source told CBS News. Chief Eddie Driggers said that he would not comment because the investigation is ongoing. Habersham was accused of excessive force by another black South Carolina resident, Sheldon Williams, 47. POLICE VERSION . Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS . Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. Relatives of Scott say their goodbyes to him on Saturday at a funeral that was was so widely attended that hundreds were left outside . Williams, who has multiple criminal convictions, said that he was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and had his face stomped on during a 2011 arrest. He said he did not resist arrest . Scott was laid to rest on Saturday, his casket draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. US senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. Slager is being held without bail and faces punishments as serious as the death penalty if convicted. Judy Scott, the mother of Walter, leaves the funeral for her son in Charleston, South Carolina. The service was also attended by a number of the state's politcians .

His body was found Monday morning. Students who were with Parks, who were all part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year, said no hazing was involved. Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, drowned in Daytona Beach on Sunday after going for a swim with friends at 3am. He was pulled out to see by a strong current and his body was later found on Monday morning . But Bethune-Cookman University is investigating Parks death after university administration 'heard rumors' that hazing was involved. Parks and the men he was swimming with were part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience, which formed last year . A Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Keisha Boyd said that the university administration had 'heard rumors' about hazing and that Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is investigating the student's death, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Parks' mother, Carolyn Parks, said she didn't know why her son would decide to swim in the ocean. 'I don't know why it happened, why he would go into the water like this, because he is not a good swimmer,' she told WESH 2. 'And I had talked to him just before he came out here and he told me he was tired and was going to rest, not knowing he was going to come out here to the beach.' Damian Parks is the second son Carolyn Parks has had to mourn in recent months. Her 16-year-old son died in Miami six months ago. Parks was with four other men in about 5ft of water near Sun Splash Park when he lost grip of a friend's clothing and a the current pulled him out to sea, according to a U.S. Coast Guard report. Parks' friends said that there was 'no foul play at all' and that is was not hazing. They added that the group was 'having fun' and that Parks had not been drinking before the incident . Uamil Turner, who was at the beach, said 'it wasn't hazing', and he was unsure where the rumor came from. Marquise Nelson, who was also at the beach with Parks, said that there 'was no foul play at all'. 'Damian didn't do anything he didn't want to do, and everyone knew that,' Nelson told the News-Journal. 'Everyone was having fun.' Parks friends said that the student had not been drinking the night he drowned nor was he impaired in any way. Deputy Chief Ray Manchester of Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue said there's no sign of hazing in the incident and that the men had, however, been out bar-hopping before going for a swim. He added that he believed 'they may have been drinking' and that the ocean was rough when the men entered the water. Students and staff at Bethune-Cookman University mourned Parks' death during a prayer vigil held on Monday after the student's body was found . The university said that though the investigation is ongoing, it still wants to celebrate Parks' life and support his family 'in this most difficult time' The university is investigating into hazing, while Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue is assisting with toxicology and witness statements, Manchester said. Bethune-Cookman spokeswoman Boyd said that though the investigation was ongoing, the university is still celebrating Parks' life. 'Once any additional information is provided by the Beach Patrol, the University will issue another statement. While information regarding the events of April 20th are continuing to surface, we ask that the public join B-CU in supporting the Parks family in this most difficult time,' she said. The university held a prayer vigil on Monday, in which University President Edison Jackson planted a tree in Parks' memory. Students at the vigil said that Parks 'never stopped laughing' and was both talented and artistic. During Monday's vigil, University President Edison planted a tree in Parks' memory. More than 100 people appeared to have shown up for Monday's vigil .","Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks, 22, drowned on Sunday .

Super agent Mino Raiola named a number of players including Everton's Romelu Lukaku as must-have signings, while also reiterating keeping hold of his client Paul Pogba is vital. Speaking to Tuttosport, the Italian revealed the stars that the Serie A champions need to buy if they want to be the best team in European football. Romelu Lukaku (left) is a player Mino Raiola has mentioned as a someone Juventus need to sign . Keeping hold of Paul Pogba (centre) is also crucial if they want to win the Champions League in the future . He said: 'In order to win the Champions League, Juve should keep Pogba, then sign Kishna from Ajax, Lukaku from Everton and Jonathas from Elche. 'In defence they ought to buy Rodrigo Ely from Avellino. He is the Pogba of defenders and is liked by half the football world, including Juve. 'Kishna would be a fantastic signing, as he's a mixture of Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel Di Maria and Robin van Persie. We'll see what Ajax think.' Ricardo Kishna celebrates after scoring during the Dutch Eredivisie the PSV and Ajax match . Kishna, 20, came up through the Ajax youth academy, with the versatility to be able to play on either wings and has taken the Eredivisie by storm.

96,"They are not the first places which come to mind when making a  booking, but as these pictures show, there are some rather interesting restaurant loos in the UK. There has been an increase in restaurants providing much more than just a meal, and as these designer toilets show, restaurants are now fighting to make themselves more memorable. Whether it's the incredible views at Aqua Shard, Sketch's futuristic pods or Abracadabra's X-rated sink ornaments, the loo is another chance for a venue to impress, and restaurants are grasping this opportunity with both hands. Weird cocooned pods comprise the intergalactic space-age landscape in the Sketch Gallery loo . Nopi's Hall of Mirrors: A work of dazzling art, you may have trouble upon both entry and escape from these labyrinthine lavatories . 'Over the last few years we've seen a marked increase in restaurants that provide much more than just a meal to the customer; these venues use every aspect of their customer experience to pack a real punch and make themselves more memorable,' said Josephine Ellis, European Head of Communications at Bookatable.co.uk. 'A big part of this has been designer toilets which often surprise diners with their fun and quirky designs at a point during a meal when all we really expect to see are cubicles and sinks,' she continued. From loos running retro nature documentaries and pre-warmed toilet seats which powder your bum once you've finished to phallic tap fittings and rusty cans serving as urinals, here at 14 of the UK's strangest loos. 1. Sketch Gallery, Mayfair . Some wonderfully weird cocooned pods comprise the intergalactic space-age landscape in the Sketch Gallery lavatories. Whilst you are in the dinosaur-egg pod, your ears will be treated to the soothing sounds of retro nature documentaries. Oh, and there are Victorian maids, just to further enhance the already esoteric setting. 2. The Bell Inn, East Sussex . Who would have thought that a trumpet could double as a urinal? The Bell Inn prove that you can simultaneously blow your horn and take a leak in their trumpet urinals. Hitting all the right notes with their wonderful quirks and boutique artefacts, The Bell Inn is a hidden restaurant and inn with bold-as-brass swagger in Ticehurst, East Sussex. The Sun Inn in Edinburgh's gloriously rustic bucket urinals where each visit really does end up in the can . Blowing your own trumpet: The men's loos in The Bell Inn, Sussex feature trumpets which double as urinals . 3. Crazy Bear, Fitzrovia . Not that we'd encourage illicit voyeurism but at Crazy Bear it's all too easy to get a glimpse into the dark side via the dazzlingly glam, open communal sinks. You enter via a concealed mirrored door, but be warned: all that glitters is seemingly not gold. With all the mirror action it can be tricky to distinguish male and females loos apart so take care not to accidentally intrude. 4. Ta Bouche Restaurant and Bar, Cambridge . Having made a real splash with their innovative video game toilets, Captive Media are on a mission to revolutionise lavatorial interior design. Even though they were rebuffed on Dragon's Den, they have gone onto furnish numerous restaurant bars with video game urinals, including venues in London and Cambridge. Open into the wee small hours, Ta Bouche Restaurant and Bar is surely the front-runner for toilet gaming technology in Cambridge.

The Japanese-inspired toilets in M Restaurants will massage you with rhythmic spurts of water then dry you off with air jets and powder your bottom before you leave . 5. M Restaurants, The City . These Japanese-heated toilets at swanky M Restaurants treat you to a proper pampering session: a nifty little control panel means that you can choose massaging water motions and complete your Tokyo-style toilet experience with drying air jets and a spot of powdering. You'll never think about a 'wash and blow dry' in the same way again. 6. Aqua Shard, London Bridge . Aqua Shard wins the prize in the stakes for adrenaline-fuelled toilet highs. You can take in the spectacular London skyline with these city-slicking powder rooms 31 floors up, surrounded by 180-degree London views. You've definitely made it when you can say you've answered the call of nature from these lofty heights. Men's toilets in Ta Bouche Restaurant and Bar, Cambridge feature video game consoles above the urinals .

Named Scottish Gastropub of The Year in 2011, The Sun Inn near Edinburgh bring their unique brand of boutique style-chic to Lothian Bridge, but it doesn't quite extend as far as the toilets. The gents have some gloriously rustic bucket urinals, meaning each visit really does end up 'in the can.' Simple, yes, but it does the job. 8. Abracadabra, Piccadilly . Talk about shooting from the lip. After less than favourable reviews from restaurant critics , Abracadabra has taken some stick for its lascivious, lipstick-mouthed lavs in the men's. For the ladies there are sophisticated, golden phallic taps. Yes. Gold. Phallic. Taps. 9. The Attendant, Fitzrovia . This is getting a bit meta. Toilets within toilets? The Attendant's key selling point is the humble water closet and it commodes your attention at every turn. After 50 years lying abandoned, these 19th-century washrooms reveal ornate Fitzrovian porcelains converted into a dining table that's so clean you could eat your dinner off it. Don't worry, it's been mega-deep-cleaned to within an inch of its life. And the toilets aren't bad either. Going down the pan? Abracadabra's lascivious, lipstick-mouthed lavs (left) and risque loo fittings (right) 10. Nopi, Soho . The menu at Nopi is rustic and directional, yet simple. The lavatories are not. A work of dazzling art, you may have trouble upon both entry and escape from these labyrinthine mirror lavatories, like a nostalgic Hall of Mirrors. Be sure to tell your guests that if you're not out in ten, send reinforcements to rescue you from the never-ending mind-trickery of the mirror maze. 11. Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town, Spitalfields . It's all rather cloak and dagger here. You need to ask to 'see the mayor' to get entry via a fridge to this secret speakeasy hangout, before taking a twisted trip back to your childhood via the fake exit door of the My Little Pony-clad lavs. If you're not into the Brony (adult fan of My Little Pony) thing, then you could skip by the Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town. Creepy commode: A distorted fairground soundtrack, dark lighting and spider-webbed walls at Sketch Lecture Room, Mayfair . Piccadilly's Abracadabra with its phallic taps in the women's loos (left) and heart covered walls (right) While Thomas Crapper didn't actually invent the humble toilet, he founded a plumbing company which now lends its name to these authentic retro-style thrones, found in Jamie's Italian, Manchester . 12. Sketch Lecture Room, Mayfair . Love checking the lavs when you visit a restaurant? Sketch features washrooms that just keep on giving, with not just one but two sets of crazy khazis. Lacroix-inspired, crystal-decked creations that are truly worthy of the royal throne mantel can be found on the way to sketch Lecture Room. A departure from the dinosaur space eggs but almost equally intriguing with a distorted fairground soundtrack and spider web-spangled walls of mystery. 13. Shaka Zulu, Camden . Shaka Zulu has earned its stripes in the exotic khazi stakes with a Zebra-zapped world of glorious toilet heaven. No, it's not safari road kill: it's art. It takes a lot of dollar to achieve this simple yet ostentatious pony-stripe effect. 14 Jamie's Italian, Manchester . Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Crapper didn't actually invent the humble toilet. However, he founded a plumbing company which now lends its name to these authentic retro-style thrones. Jamie Oliver clearly favours an authentic variety of toilet seat and has installed these loos across his restaurant group, including Jamie's Italian in Manchester which features an original Thomas Crapper toilet.","Rustic cans serve as urinals in the award-winning The Sun Inn, Edinburgh .

Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

Seconds later they charge, tear gas flowing around them. Other frames show venerated leaders of the Civil Rights Movement marching implacably, despite the threat of harm to them and their supporters. The images, now fifty years old, have been assembled from the work of three photographers covering the marches, and are now being displayed in a New York City photography exhibition.

High-quality images of the authorities' brutal response helped galvanize change and push through the Voting Rights Act just five months later. However, the transmission of the images was far from guaranteed - Martin recalled how his editors initially tried to suppress his images.

100,"The Great British Bake Off presenter Sue Perkins is taking a break from Twitter after men began sending her death threats in response to her becoming the bookmakers' favourite to replace Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear. Last week, a flurry of bets placed on Perkins, 45, propelled her to the top spot for the now-vacant position, according to bookmakers Coral. But announcing her departure from the social media site this morning, the popular TV personality tweeted: 'My timeline has been full of blokes wishing me dead...

Before leaving the site today, Perkins responded to comments by tweeting: 'Yawn. a/ not up for the job b/ couldn't imagine anything worse than doing it. Off you pop and troll s/one else.' Clarkson's future at the BBC remains uncertain but he will be back on the channel later this month to host satirical quiz show Have I Got News For You.

101,"Moments after last night's TV contest came off air, Labour's election chief Douglas Alexander was briefing journalists on how well his man had done. Without doubt Ed Miliband had won, he declared confidently. But he was cut off mid-sentence by news that the first poll was in, which told a different story. Some 54 per cent of people thought David Cameron had triumphed, which is a slender win for the Tory camp who have grown complacent about the idea that Mr Miliband's dire personal ratings will stop his path to Number 10. Two snap polls after the TV election contest gave David Cameron the lead - but only just . David Cameron and Ed Miliband were interviewed by Jeremy Paxman and questioned by an audience of voters as part of the first TV election contest of the campaign . Pollster ICM said its snap verdict giving a narrow victory for Mr Cameron in the first of the leaders' election broadcasts represented the company's 'best guess' of the nationwide response. In is survey for the Guardian it found that 46 per cent  felt that Mr Cameron had the best arguments, as against 44 per cent who said the same of Mr Miliband. The Prime Minister was judged marginally more convincing than the panel, by a difference of 48 per cent to 43 per cent. The ICM panel also felt Mr Cameron better answered the questions he was asked, winning on this measure by 44 per cent to 37 per cent. In a boost for Labour,56 per cent of floating voters said they were more likely to vote Labour, compared with 30 per cent more likely to vote Conservative. However, those in this section of the group were only a very small sub-set of the wider group. A separate YouGov App result found 51 per cent thought Mr Cameron won, with Mr Miliband on 49 per cent. The two men vying for the keys to Number 10 on May 7 did not go head-to-head but instead appeared separately to be interviewed by Paxman and questioned by an audience of voters. In an 18-minute grilling, Mr Cameron was forced to defend not cutting immigration while putting up VAT, questioned about the rise of food banks in Britain and his failure to spell out where £12billion in welfare cuts will come from. Jeremy Paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing Prime Minister David Cameron . And he appeared taken aback when asked about the company he keeps, including a minister caught up in a tax scandal, a spin doctor jailed for phone hacking and being friends with Jeremy Clarkson, who was sacked from Top Gear after punching a colleague. But Mr Miliband faced a difficult ride time from both the studio audience and Paxman about whether he is tough enough to lead the country. The Labour leader insisted: 'Am I tough enough? Hell, yes, I'm tough enough.' The contest was played out on social media, with almost every TV-related tweet sent last night discussing the election contest. In a blog post, Twitter cited Kantar Media analysis stating the debate made up 94.7 per cent of UK Twitter conversation about TV over the evening, with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm. There were more mentions of Mr Cameron than Mr Miliband but Labour saw more mentions than the Conservatives, while the moment that generated the most tweets came at the end of the debate as Mr Paxman asked the Labour leader: 'Are you OK, Ed?' Ukip leader Nigel Farage and media mogul Rupert Murdoch were among those whose eyes were glued to Sky and Channel 4's much-anticipated question and answer session with David Cameron and Ed Miliband. The debate accounted for 94.7 per cent of UK Twitter conversation about TV over the evening, with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm . When the Labour leader declared he was tough enough to be prime minister by virtue of having stood up to Mr Murdoch, the News International owner tweeted: 'Thanks for 2 mentions, Ed Miliband. Only met once for all of 2 minutes when you embarrassed me with over the top flattery.' Former Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother star Katie Hopkins was not impressed with Miliband either, tweeting: 'If this man is Prime Minister I will leave the UK. This man is not Great Britain. This is Russell Brand in a chuffing suit.' And Ann Summer's CEO Jacqueline Gold said: 'This is not the same Labour Party that people voted for under Blair. Miliband is like Kinnock without the personality.' But Mr Farage had a kind word for his Labour counterpart, tweeting: 'Miliband is showing more humour and courage than Cameron! BattleForNumber10.' But he attacked Mr Miliband over Europe and immigration and mocked Mr Cameron for being 'smarmy'. The South Thanet parliamentary candidate said: 'His constant complimenting of audience for their questions is making Cameron look rather smarmy and lacking in sincerity.' Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell felt it was good night for Mr Miliband. He said: 'Good night for Ed, neutral for Kay, bad for Jeremy, dire for Dave.' Others questioned Mr Paxman's skills as an interviewer, with Apprentice boss Lord Sugar tweeting: 'I think Miliband made mincemeat out of Paxman.' Piers Morgan weighed in, tweeting: 'Paxman eviscerated Cameron with such masterful savagery ... that Cameron won all the debate polls.' But Match Of The Day host Gary Lineker backed the former Newsnight anchor, saying: 'Audience questions after Paxman is like when Spurs bring on Soldado for Harry Kane.' As did BBC presenter Andrew Neil: 'Paxo was superb tonight. But winging it towards end with Miliband. Seemed better prepared against Cameron.' And he added: 'Miliband was struggling at times but viewers will perhaps think he stood up better to Paxo than the PM.'","ICM/Guardian poll found 54% thought Cameron won with Miliband on 46% .

103,"A young fisherman in Thailand reeled in the catch of the day after hooking a fish with a plastic toy fishing rod – but was the achievement just a hoax? Captured standing on the bank of what appears to be a lake, the youngster – with a big grin on his face – holds onto a tiny blue and yellow fishing rod. Approaching the water, the young boy reels rapidly, but at this point it isn’t clear whether or not he has hooked anything. The youngster stands on the bank of what appears to be a lake  and holds a tiny blue and yellow fishing rod . He then crouches down by the side of the water and moves his rod from side to side – tension on the end of it is now visible. Fighting against what may well be a weed, the young boy continues to reel and before long a fish breaks the surface of the water. As it splashes about, the youngster puts his hand into the lake and plucks it out. He then lays it on the floor before confidently putting his finger in its mouth, removing the hook and proudly lifting it up to the camera. The young Thai boy crouches down by the side of the water and moves his rod from side to side while reeling . Discussing the video with MailOnline, Nathan Wardle of Mega Fishing Thailand, said that the fish was most likely a Nile Tilapia, although it is hard to see exactly from the clip. He added: ‘They are found in almost every river, lake or pond right through the whole of Thailand and were introduced back in 1967 as a gift from Japan to the Thai King. ‘Many people farm them in small numbers in their ponds for food. The fry can be bought for about 8p each. ‘They are very popular stocked in fishing parks where they will cook your catch and small ones are used as bait for the big monster fish we have here. The fish breaks the surface of the water and the boy bravely puts his hand into the lake to catch it . The boy plucks the fish from the water, lays it on the floor and confidently puts his finger in its mouth to remove the hook . ‘They are also great table fish, served up in most restaurants. They have really tasty meat that can be fried, poached, roasted or barbecued and usually come with some kind of spicy Thai dipping sauce. ‘The fish eat pretty much anything so are fairly easy to catch with worms, bread, shrimps or squid and the like.’ Since it was uploaded, the video has been viewed over a million times and many people have commented to congratulate the youngster. However, there is a suggestion that the fish may have been hooked to the line before the start of the video. The youngster proudly holds his catch, which appears to be a Nile Tilapia, up to the camera .","The young boy holds a tiny  blue and yellow toy fishing rod .

105,"While being white, blonde and an attractive Anglo-Saxon shouldn't ensue judgement, according to Ellie Laing, SBS news reporter, it does come with a barrage of unfair perceptions. In an article by The Australian written on Monday, Jim Carroll, the News and Current Affairs Director of SBS, was reported to be taking a more 'commercial' approach to the network by hiring 'good-looking, female, Anglo-Celtic' journalists. While Carroll denies  he is hiring based on these standards, many of the journalists hired since his appointment in 2013 have fit the above bill. 'Never mind the fact that I work damned hard': SBS reporter Ellie Laing has launched a scathing attack on an article in The Australian that suggested she and other journalists were hired for being young, white and female . Ellie Laing,  SBS news reporter who was hired by Carroll, has now hit back at claims she was hired for her beauty over her brains in an open letter to critics. 'When a compliment suggesting I might be, in some way “attractive,"" I’ll take it, with delight,' she wrote in an open letter circulated to several news outlets. 'What I won’t take is a suggestion that because I'm “attractive”, white and a woman it somehow detracts from the credibility and substance of the news service I work for.' Laing also wrote that despite a near decade of experience, hard work, established contacts and a regular six day week gig working as a journalism teacher at Macleay College on the side, none of this was taken into account. Diversity: The SBS was criticised for hiring young attractive reporters, with Sarah Abo one of the journalists mentioned in the article . 'In my case it didn't mention the near decade of experience I could bring to the newsroom after enjoying a long career across radio and TV at the ABC, Seven and Ten. Never mind the fact that I work damned hard.' The article also commented on the SBS content taking a more 'fluffy' lifestyle approach , which Laing shot back at by insisting  a need for an inclusion of the arts and a more balanced approach to hard news. Beyond the affront on her looks, credibility and the content, Laing made sure to clear up one thing  - she was hired for passion, not because she 'scrubs up alright.' Alyshia Gates is another of the SBS journalists whose position were questioned by The Australian . Finishing her letter with a fiery response for The Australian journalist behind the controversial article, Laing said: 'If he’d watched the bulletin a bit closer he would have seen I’ve changed my name to Ellie Laing (too). I got married late last year. And yes, on my wedding day, I looked the most “attractive” I've ever been.' While Laing stands by Carroll and claims that suggest the over importance her looks play, this article comes at the same week Karen Middleton,  SBS political correspondent announced her departure from the network. It's believed by insiders she didn't have the right 'profile' to fit Carroll's new criterion. Whether it's sexism based on attractiveness or unattractiveness, age or cultural background it could be said the head of network's values to be 'independent from external pressures to conform or favour' and 'provide a real multi cultural and contemporary Australia' are coming under question.","Ellie Laing spoke out against claims of being hired for looks alone .

111,"(CNN)A quick descent. No distress call. The pilot's actions. It will be months, or longer, before the causes behind Tuesday's crash of Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 are known, but there are initial clues that aviation experts say will be the most important to investigators. Speculation comes in the wake of any tragedy such as this, but experts say certain facts can be significant for those who want to know what happened. The most useful clues so far: . One of the plane's ""black boxes"" has been recovered, the French interior minister said. The data recorder will be the most useful in determining the cause of the crash. Its contents are still unknown, but it is a good sign that it was found just hours after the crash. France's aviation accident investigation bureau will examine the device immediately, the interior minister said. Real-time flight data available to the public tells a key part of the story. According to online flight trackers, the Germanwings plane had been flying at 38,000 feet when, about 30 minutes into the trip, it started descending. Six minutes later, it was recorded at 24,000 feet -- a drop of 14,000 feet. It continued to descend after that -- it's last recorded altitude was 11,400 feet. The rate of descent indicates that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent, CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said. If the engines had stalled, the plane would have crashed in less time, she said. Departure: Barcelona, Spain, at 10:01 a.m. (26 minutes late) Destination: Scheduled to land in Dusseldorf, Germany, at 11:39 a.m. Passengers: 150 (144 passengers, six crew members) Airplane: Airbus A320 (twin-jet) Airline: Germanwings (budget airline owned by Lufthansa) Flight distance: 726 miles . Last known tracking data: 10:38 a.m. Last known speed: 480 mph . Last known altitude: 11,400 feet . Last known location: Near Digne-les-Bains, France, in the Alps . Sources: CNN and flightaware.com . The initial data about the plane's descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing, or that the plane was gliding with the pilot's guidance, Schiavo said. A scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains, she said. Another aviation analyst, David Soucie, said the quickness of the descent shows something went wrong, but also that the plane was not out of control. The plane was descending ""faster than an elevator at that point. You're feeling it down. It's pulling you down, and you can sense that,"" Soucie said. A telling piece of data is that the plane maintained speed as it descended, he said. It could show that the pilot was aware that something was wrong and was controlling the speed as the plane went down. ""It was a controlled descent, and there was something that had gone wrong that he had no control over or he would have controlled it,"" Soucie said. The data on air traffic accidents are clear: A majority of accidents happen upon takeoff or landing. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, even though 83% of a plane's flight time is taken up with the climb, cruise and descent phases, less than 16% of accidents happen during this period. Soucie described the timing of the crash as an ""anomalous thing that happened."" It is ""incredibly rare to happen in the middle of the flight,"" he said, meaning the pilot would have to act fast. Contrary to some early reports, the French Civil Aviation Authority told CNN that the crew of the Germanwings plane did not issue a distress call. It was air traffic controllers who sent out a distress call after radio contact with the plane was lost. The lack of an emergency call can raise a red flag to a nonpilot. Why would a pilot not alert someone that there is an emergency? Does it hint to an incursion in the cockpit or a pilot's motives? It might sound counterintuitive, but calling for help is not the first thing on a pilot's checklist when things go wrong. Soucie said the principle that a pilot follows during an emergency is this: Aviate, navigate and communicate. In other words, before turning on a distress call or transponder, the pilot's first concern is to fly the plane, and secondly, to find the safest option for a crash landing, if it comes to that. The Germanwings pilot ""was definitely aviating and navigating from what we can tell,"" Soucie said. The pilot was conceivably looking for a place to try to land, he said. A distress call -- had it happened -- could have signaled a different story. Schiavo explained that there are codes that pilots have -- certain words that if uttered by the pilot indicate to air traffic controllers that there is a hijacking. The initial reports are that there was no hijack code transmitted from the plane. A big part of determining the cause of the crash will be whether such a code was sent or not. ""I don't think you'd rule anything out at this point,"" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. ""It's not like it appears as if it was an in-flight breakup. So what was going on in the cockpit is what we're going to be talking about in the coming days."" O'Brien pointed out the known details of the crash -- a rapid descent, no radio call and a flight that continues into the mountains -- are not part of a ""typical emergency scenario."" There were no reported weather issues during the plane's flight, but that does not mean you can rule these out as a possible cause, pilot and CNN aviation analyst Les Abend said. One thing Abend was looking at was a cold front progressing in the area where the plane was. It indicated some precipitation at lower altitudes. So there may not have been bad weather at the cruising altitude, but ""at lower altitudes, as they were beginning the descent, their visibility may have been obscured,"" Abend said. Reduced visibility in and of itself is not a huge issue, but the weather may have deteriorated as the plane descended and be a possible factor in the crash, he said.","CNN aviation analyst says this is not a typical emergency incident, but all possibilities are part of probe .
The cause behind the crash of the Germanwings plane is unknown .
There are early clues, however, that will be key to investigators ."

113,"A company advertising a competition to win a £2,000 luxury holiday to Ireland have blundered by using a photo of a castle in Scotland. And the mistake has been met with anger by officials at popular tourist hotspot north of the border. The contest to win a trip to the Emerald Isle is being promoted with a picture of Eilean Donan Castle, which is in the western Highlands  and seen by many as one of Scotland's most famous castle. WomenFreebies.co.uk used a photo of Scottish Castle Eilean Donan to advertise a competition for Ireland . Unsurprisingly, the use of the Scottish castle advertising a holiday to Ireland didn't go down too well... The Eilean Donan Castle officials had some words of advice for the website WomenFreebies.co.uk . The image was posted to the Facebook page of WomenFreebies.co.uk with the caption 'Like if you'd love to visit Ireland'. The page has almost 800,000 followers and thousands liked the post, but eagle-eyed Scots spotted the gaffe and pointed out the mistake. Nikki Thompson, 63, of Ardrishaig in Argyll, said: 'I laughed to myself. I knew right away that it was the Eilean Donan - it's not in Ireland. 'It's obviously the wrong castle in the wrong place. 'If you are going to advertise a luxury holiday in Ireland, you should at least have a picture of Ireland, you would think. 'I actually messaged them but they never got back to me.' Eilean Donan Castle's website describes the site as 'one of the most iconic images of Scotland . The first fortified castle was built in the mid 13th century and stood guard over the lands of Kintail. And officials at the castle waded into the topic when they posted their own response on the competition page by writing: 'We are NOT impressed at all!!!'. On the castle's official Facebook page they posted some advice for the competition organisers by writing: 'Somebody somewhere REALLY needs a Geography lesson! And fast!!' Also on Facebook, Martin Davis wrote: 'If you want to visit THIS castle, then you'd have to be in Scotland! Eilean Donan Castle in the Highlands!' Kathryn Seddon added: 'Sounds nice, but it's a shame they can't show a picture of Ireland and not Eilean Donan Castle in the beautiful Scottish Highlands!' The administrators of the page have not responded to a request for comment. Eilean Donan Castle's website describes the site as 'one of the most iconic images of Scotland, 'recognised all around the world,' and that the castle is now 'one of the most visited and important attractions in the Scottish highlands.'

115,"A Dutch mother has abducted two of her four children and taken them to join militants fighting for the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Syria. The unnamed 32-year-old  Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa. The father of the missing children named the pair as Luca, seven, and his sister Aysha, eight, and said they had been taken without his consent. The woman's two other children are believed to have been handed over to a relative before she left to join the terror group. Abducted: The father of the missing children named the pair as 'Luca', seven, (left) and his sister 'Aysha', eight, (right) and said they had been taken without his consent . The missing woman, who has not yet been named, fled the Netherlands with two of her children last October, the Dutch prosecution's office confirmed this morning. Snatched: Eight-year-old Dutch girl 'Aysha' was abducted by her mother and taken to join ISIS . It is the first known instance of children in the Netherlands being abducted and taken to join ISIS. According to the Dutch newspaper De Limburger, the children's father had previously reported his estranged wife to the police because he was concerned she was planning to travel to Syria. Officers are said to have questioned the woman several times but she denied having intentions to join ISIS and investigators could find no evidence of concrete travel plans. Shortly afterwards the woman vanished from Maastricht with two of the children, prompting Dutch officials to launch a major alert, leading to an international arrest warrant being issued. Despite this the woman later took to Facebook to declare that she and her two children had arrived in the terrorists' de facto capital Raqqa, having used fake passports to travel across Europe. After making the announcement of their arrival in Raqqa on Facebook last October, nothing has been heard from the trio since. Dutch officials said they had no way of telling whether the group were still alive, with prosecutor Bart den Hartigh declaring the recovery of the children 'impossible' as the Netherlands has no legal relationship with either the Syrian regime or the terror group that controls the city of Raqqa. No place for children: The unnamed 32-year-old Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa (pictured) The news comes as an 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State. West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham, was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. It comes the day after it three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, in a dramatic security operation. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Istanbul after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned  on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism.","Chechen national, 32, took children from home in Maastricht, Netherlands .

118,"A Los Angeles judge agreed with the governor's decision to reject parole for a Charles Manson follower imprisoned 43 years for two brutal murders. Bruce Davis' record shows there is 'some evidence' he is dangerous and shouldn't be freed, Superior Court Judge William C. Ryan wrote in a decision filed Wednesday. Davis, 72, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea and sentenced to life in prison in 1972. He was 30 years old at the time. Then and now: Bruce Davis, Charles Manson's former follower (pictured left in 1970 and right in March 2014), has been denied parole after spending 43 years in prison for a double homicide in 1969 . Bloodthirsty: Bruce Davis held Gary Hinman, a friend, at gunpoint while Charles Manson (pictured) sliced his face open with a sword . Davis, who once bragged of cutting Shea's head off, claimed he has turned his life around in prison, earning a doctoral degree in philosophy, becoming religious and ministering to other inmates. He also married a woman he met through the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter. The couple recently divorced. The parole board cited those accomplishments, along with his age and good behavior as reasons to grant him parole in March last year. Gov. Jerry Brown rejected that decision in August, saying factors in his favor were outweighed by the brutality of the killings and Davis' lack of insight into the crimes, which he didn't admit until 2012 after claiming for years to be an innocent bystander. The Manson family planned to rob Hinman, a friend, but killed him after holding him two days because he said he didn't have money. Davis held Hinman at gunpoint while Manson sliced his face open with a sword. About a month later, Davis stabbed Shea, who worked at Spahn Ranch where the family lived. His body was found buried on the property years later. Homicidal maniac: Charles Manson, pictured left in 2011, orchestrated the murders of eight people in 1969, including actress Sharon Tate (right). Davis did not play a part in her slaying . 'Both victims were abused, defiled and mutilated,' Ryan wrote. 'These actions demonstrate the utmost callous disregard for human suffering.' The judge said he gave broad deference to Brown's discretion and that the governor's decision in August didn't amount to cruel or unusual punishment. Davis' lawyer had not seen the decision, but said he would appeal to a higher court. 'I'm stunned. I can't believe he would do that,' attorney Michael Evan Beckman said. 'The judge is wrong.' The parole board has found Davis suitable for release three times, but Brown and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger reversed the decision each time. Steve Grogan, another participant in those murders, was released many years ago after he agreed to lead police to where the bodies were buried on a remote movie ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Captured: Steve Grogan (left) and Bruce Davis (right) enter court to be tried for murder in 1970 . Brainwashed: Manson family murderers Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle and Leslie van Houton . Davis was not involved in the notorious killings of actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski, and six others and was considered a better candidate for release. Manson and three followers, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles 'Tex' Watson, remain in prison for life in the Tate killings. Co-defendant Susan Atkins died of cancer behind bars in 2009.","Bruce Davis, 72, was convicted in 1969 slayings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea .

119,"Jordan Sharifi, 17,  confessed to giving a gun to friend Raymond Howell, who killed himself . A teenager who allegedly gave his best friend a gun for protection from bullies has been arrested after the boy used the weapon to kill himself. Jordan Sharifi, 17, was taken into custody on Friday by police in McKinney, Texas, who say he confessed to giving a gun and  ammunition to 14-year-old Raymond Howell, Jr. On Thursday, Raymond was found in a ditch from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Sharifi discovered Raymond's body in a rain culvert after the boy's mother called to ask him if he'd seen her son, according to an affidavit, the Dallas Morning News reported. When he saw his friend in a fetal position in the ditch, he initially thought he was sleeping and called his name, he told police. But when Raymond failed to respond, Sharifi turned him over and saw blood on his face, and found no pulse, he said. At that point, he noticed the weapon beneath Raymond's body and threw it into a nearby drainage tunnel. Sharifi led police to the scene and they initially thought Raymond had been murdered because they did not find a weapon, the affidavit states. Speaking to police, Sharifi initially denied seeing a weapon but later admitted that he had given the boy the gun and had tried to hide it when he found it beneath his body. Loss: The body of Raymond Howell, Jr., pictured, was found early on Thursday morning a few miles from his school. Sharifi found his friend's body after Raymond's mother told him the boy was missing . Friends: The boys, who became friends after Sharifi moved next door, are pictured together with a friend . On social media, he also indicated that his friend had left him a note before taking his life. The two teenagers became friends after Sharifi moved in with one of Raymond's neighbors. 'No one understands how hard it is to lose someone so close to them, and to have found them before anyone else knew,' Sharifi wrote on Instagram last week. 'But I knew that you wanted me to find you and me to tell your mom and no one else, I will always cherish the letter that you wrote to me, and left for me to find, I love you so much man.' Sharifi, who once attended McKinney Boyd High School with Howell but is no longer enrolled there, allegedly confessed to police that he'd stolen the gun from the family he was staying with. He says he gave Howell the gun to protect himself after he'd gotten into some fights recently. Sharifi was charged with fabricating or tampering with evidence, theft of a firearm and making a firearm accessible to a child. His bond has been set at $300,000. Confessed: Police say Sharifi, pictured left, led them to Howell's body before confessing he stole a gun from a family he was staying with and gave it, along with several rounds of ammunition, to Howell . Discovery: Sharifi says he found Howell's body after he got a call from Howell's mom asking him if he'd seen her son. On social media, he also indicated that the boy had left him a note before taking his life . Howell's devastated parents released a statement on Monday. 'We want to thank our friends, family and the public for the outpouring of support that we have received regarding the loss of our son and brother, Raymond ""Junior"" Howell. 'Even at the tender age of 14, Raymond lived a life of love, strong values and integrity that some people never fully experience... 'Our hope is that it one day allows for a truly meaningful conversation…and more importantly real change for the way we treat others in our schools and throughout our communities.' Friends recalled him as a happy and friendly teenager, but said he had recently asked for a transfer after being bullied by older students, CBS reported last week. 'There were people who didn't like him, but it's life - there's always someone that won't like you,' family friend Aleena Rogers, 16, told the Dallas Morning News. 'But those were very few and far between for him. He was loved by most everyone.' Tragedy: Howell was discovered dead near this rain culvert just a few miles from his high school . School: He was a freshman at McKinney Boyd High but had reportedly asked for a transfer because he was being bullied. The school district said on Monday it has found no evidence he had reported the bullying . She said he was always helping other people and called him 'an amazing guy with a huge heart'. But the high school said it had not found any evidence that the teenager or his parents had contacted administrators with concerns that he was the victim of bullying. The district's anti-bullying policy forbids name-calling, threats, taunting, teasing and assault, the Morning News reported. It also asks students to report bullying to school or district employees. 'The natural inclination is to find blame in these situations,' spokesman Cody Cunningham said on Monday. 'But as of today, we still have not found any reports from the family, from other peers, from teachers, of any potential bullying.' District officials continue to investigate. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Jordan Sharifi, 17, 'gave Raymond Howell, Jr., 14, a gun and ammunition to protect himself from bullies but Raymond used the gun to take his life'

123,"(CNN)As a manager at several prominent media outlets, Katharine Zaleski did not understand the demands on working moms and often belittled their work ethic. Then she became a mom, and everything changed. In a widely shared piece this week for Fortune.com, the journalist-turned-startup executive apologizes for disparaging the mothers she worked with in her 20s at the Huffington Post and Washington Post. Zaleski said she committed multiple ""infractions,"" against these women, including scheduling late-afternoon meetings or happy hours without considering that mothers with after-work responsibilities wouldn't be able to attend. She even didn't disagree ""when another female editor said we should hurry up and fire another woman before she 'got pregnant.' "" Now a mother to a young daughter, Zaleski said she was wrong to undervalue mothers' contributions by counting hours logged in the office and not the actual work done. ""I wish I had known five years ago, as a young, childless manager, that mothers are the people you need on your team,"" she wrote. ""There's a saying that 'if you want something done then ask a busy person to do it.' That's exactly why I like working with mothers now."" Zaleski's piece has been shared more than 1,000 times and has been hailed on social media by many commenters who applaud her for seeing the error of her ways. ""Your message is so important and it's about time it was addressed,"" said Heather Bouvier on Twitter. ""THANK YOU for writing this. There are so many people like your then-childless 28-year-old self who need to read it. Seriously, thank you from the bottom of my heart,"" wrote Alice Gomstyn on Facebook. Since the essay was published Tuesday, Zaleski told CNN she's received more than 2,000 emails from readers who admit they've committed similar infractions in the workplace. ""I'm so motivated and thrilled,"" she said.  ""I couldn't be more psyched for the responses."" But not all the responses have been positive. Some people refuse to accept Zaleski's apology and accuse her of borrowing from similar apologetic essays by other new moms. ""This woman has basically stolen another woman's post about her views on mothers with children in the workforce for her own personal gain!!,"" wrote one commenter on Zaleski's essay. Others accuse Zaleski of writing the essay just to promote the new company she co-founded, Power to Fly, an online platform that matches women with technical skills to freelance projects they can do from anywhere. ""This woman & her shameless self-promoting article disgust me. No awareness. No integrity,"" Kitten Holiday said on Twitter. Zaleski said that notion is ""just silly,"" and she's taken a huge risk leaving a stable job to start a company that is a part of the solution. Zaleski said her company, which launched in August, enables women to work from home so that they can ""be valued for their productivity and not time spent sitting in an office or at a bar bonding afterwards."" But some critics say encouraging mothers to work from home only perpetuates a problem. ""I like this article a lot, but wish the solution wasn't to have a company that helps mothers find jobs that keep them tucked away at home, but to change the dominant culture to create better, more supportive workplaces where flexible schedules are encouraged,"" said Suzanne Pekow Carlson on Facebook. Others say they wish Zaleski went further, and instead of only addressing the challenges of the working mother, wished she'd included other caregivers, like dads. ""I hope the convo ... expands beyond just working moms to working dads, folks taking care of sick parents, etc.,"" ABC's Karen Travers said on Twitter. ""I don't understand why we still refuse to acknowledge that our society needs to be more flexible for PARENTS. It is not just the woman's burden,"" said Margaret Weingart Berger on Facebook. And said another commenter on Zaleski's essay, ""If it takes this woman becoming a mother to understand the value of working mothers and have compassion for them, then I guess we can't expect men to understand and have compassion because they will never be able to be mothers themselves."" Zaleski said she finds the criticism ""frustrating,"" but said she refuses to dwell on the negative.  She wants to ""stay focused on helping women find fulfilling work they can do from home."" She said her essay represents her ""own personal experience,"" which happens to mostly involve working with mothers. But she's glad her piece has opened a dialogue and she hopes the conversation continues. Women not supporting women ""is a systemic problem in our society,"" Zaleski said. Serena Markstrom Nugent, posting on Facebook, agreed. ""To the women mad at her (Zaleski) and saying too little too late: She not only had not had kids but was very young and ambitious. In the spirit of not tearing down other women, I would say cheer her on for where she is on in the journey,"" she wrote. ""Still young, still learning, and at least at this point, it appears, part of the solution."" Still other critics suggest the issue isn't as simple as parents versus non-parents in the workplace. Instead, they say, it's about the lack of empathy that exists between colleagues whose circumstances are different from their own. ""Why is it necessary to 'walk in someone's shoes' before we understand their perspective?"" said Ann OConnell on Facebook. ""Until we strive to have understanding and compassion for people regardless of our personal circumstances or life choices, we will remain selfish and self-centered as a whole.""","Katharine Zaleski said she judged working moms before she became one .

126,"Newcastle United hotshot Adam Armstrong scored the winner as England's under 18s beat Switzerland in a behind-closed-doors friendly at St George's Park. Armstrong popped up three minutes after half-time, firing home at the second attempt after Swiss goalkeeper Gregord Kobel blocked an initial one-on-one attempt. But Neil Dewsnip's team missed several good chances and the coach will hope they are more clinical when the two sides reconvene at Walsall's Banks's Stadium on Saturday. Newcastle United striker Adam Armstrong scored the winner as England's under 18s beat Switzerland . England coach Neil Dewsnip would be disappointed that England wasted a number of chances . It was a strong side that lined up at the England headquarters in Staffordshire, with Chelsea's Dominic Solanke, Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo and Everton's Ryan Ledson among the players on show. Dewsnip also handed international debuts to Sheffield United midfielder Louis Reed and Fulham goalkeeper Magnus Norman. And Norman was almost involved inside the first minute when Swiss forward Neftali Manzambi burst through, only to be denied by a last-ditch challenge by Manchester City's Tosin Adarabioyo. Gradually, England asserted themselves and Solanke, who trained with the first team the other day, was inches away from turning home a low Ojo cross. Ojo, the Liverpool prodigy currently out on loan at Wigan Athletic, was denied by Kobel shortly afterwards having been slipped clear by Solanke. The pressure was relentless and Reed, keen to make a positive impression, curled an effort just wide of the post after Southampton man Josh Sims and Armstrong combined to tee him up. Chelsea forward Dominic Solanke featured for England in their win at St George's Park . The busy Kobel was again tested in the dying seconds of the half, tipping Ojo's header over the crossbar following more good build-up work from Armstrong and Everton defender Jonjoe Kenny. After Armstrong finally made the breakthrough, England were able to relax a little but they continued to create chances at regular intervals. Ojo fired over the bar after more good work from the lively Armstrong and Kobel was called upon to deny Solanke, who made his Chelsea first-team debut earlier this season. Armstrong could have added a second after finding himself in an identical situation to his goal but on this occasion the goalkeeper saved. Tammy Abraham, who has featured in Chelsea's run to the FA Youth Cup final, came on for Solanke and nearly claimed his first England goal late on, only to fire inches wide. England play Switzerland at Walsall on Saturday (5.30pm). The Liverpool starlet Sheyi Ojo also featured in the friendly match at England's Staffordshire headquarters . England (4-1-2-1-2): Magnus Norman (Farnborough, on-loan from Fulham); Jonjoe Kenny (Everton), Tosin Adarabioyo (Manchester City), Taylor Moore (RC Lens), Callum Connolly (Everton); Ryan Ledson (C) (Everton); Louis Reed (Sheffield United), Josh Sims (Southampton); Sheyi Ojo (wigan Athletic, on-loan from Liverpool); Adam Armstrong (Newcastle United), Dominic Solanke (Chelsea) Substitutions: Jake Clarke-Salter (Chelsea) for Adarabioyo 45; Tammy Abraham (Chelsea) for Solanke 64; Josh Onomah (Tottenham) for Ojo 64; Ainsley Maitland-Niles (Arsenal) for Reed 81; Harry Chapman (Middlesbrough) for Sims 81 .

128,"The price of olive oil is expected to rocket as forestry officials in southern Italy yesterday began cutting down thousands of olive trees infected with a deadly bacteria. The xylella fastidiosa bacteria has ravaged olive trees in the Puglia region and contributed to a 35 percent drop in the region's olive oil production last year. Its spread has so alarmed the EU that France announced a boycott of Puglian fruit and vegetables, while its effect on production will mean shortages in the supply of olive oil and is likely to lead to higher prices for shoppers in Britain and around the world. An Italian forestry official stands guard as workers begin chopping down an infected olive oil tree . Police officers were also on hand to maintain order after protesters attempted to stop the trees' destruction . A forestry official walks past the fenced-off remains of an olive oil tree destroyed in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease . A forestry worker cuts through the stump of a tree infected with the deadly xylella fastidiosa bacteria . Puglian growers have opposed the government's destruction plan, saying it won't stop the bacteria's spread . However, Puglian growers have opposed the government's slash-and-burn plan, saying it won't contain the bacteria's spread. Several dozen protesters tried unsuccessfully yesterday to block the first seven trees from being felled in Oria, near Brindisi, even climbing the branches and shouting 'assassins.' Eventually, the first seven trees were cut down and are to be burned today, with more to follow. Many of Italy's oldest olive groves, some dating back 500 years, have been infected by the bacterium, which causes plants to shrivel, leaving them incapable of bearing fruit. Puglia, a region in the heel of Italy, produces about 11million tons of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop, and they are used to make some of the country's best oils. The initial area to be culled is 20,000 acres – about 30 sq miles – between Lecce to Brindisi. It contains around 11million trees, according to Unaprol, the largest consortium of growers. It is feared that unless drastic action is taken to fell the groves, the bacterium will spread to other olive-producing regions of Italy such as Tuscany and Umbria, and even to other Mediterranean countries. Last month Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for Food Safety and Security, said he was 'profoundly concerned by the gravity of the situation'. He added: 'We have to take decisive measures with immediate effect. Naturally it is very painful for the growers but it is necessary to remove all the affected trees, it is the most effective measure.' The bacteria (right) causes plants to dry out, leaving shrivelled stumps that are incapable of bearing fruit. Pictured left are protesters sitting in the branches of an olive oil tree earmarked for destruction . The microbe, first identified in the Americas, has now infected 800,000 trees in Salento, the southern half of Puglia, the heel of Italy . Below is a summary of the Italian virgin olive oil market worldwide, according to Unaprol (organisation of Italian oil producers), showing the main importing countries: . USA: Italy holds a market share of 51 per cent, with exports up 2 per cent in 2013. AUSTRIA: Italy is the market leader in 2013 with a 48 per cent share. BRAZIL: Italy is the fourth-largest virgin oil supplier to Brazil with 7 per cent of the market, following Portugal, Spain and Argentina.

But after the stencil was granted Grade II-listed status, Mr Possee, 45, has been unable to remove and sell it - and cannot carry out building work to make the house habitable. Scroll down for video . Eavesdropping: Spybooth features three 1950s-style agents, wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats, using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box on the side of the £300,000 property . Public interest: Dozens of people came to see the artwork after it was sprayed onto the side of an end-of-terrace property close to Britain's surveillance centre in April 2014 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . As a result he cannot rent out the home, which is empty. He claimed he has been harassed by ‘malicious busybodies’ and now just wants to sell the property - so he can ‘get on with my life’. Mr Possee said: ‘If Cheltenham want it, they can have it. Just buy the building off me, I just want to get on with my life.

It was feared the chunk of wall could be removed and sold, but last month Cheltenham Borough Council voted to incorporate the mural into the building’s existing Grade II-listed status. This means Mr Possee - whose home is thought to have tripled in value since the mural was painted - now cannot carry out urgent repairs to strengthen and re-render the walls. He said: ‘If this had been any other artist, it [the listed status] would have been laughed out of the chambers. I have no idea where I go from here.' Mr Possee said he could fight the decision, but that would mean him spending his own money to launch a case at the High Court. He said the council ‘agreed in principle’ to protect the mural when he first approached them for help.

Mr Possee said he has had 'substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork' ‘They just said “you can’t put that on there” and I was threatened with a fine.' He added: 'I think it deserves to stay in Cheltenham, but obviously it is difficult to re-render a house that has that artwork on it. ‘It’s sat empty now, and it can’t stay that way forever. At the end of the day, we can sit and let gravity take an effect and the decision will be made for us.’ Mr Possee has even been targeted by men posing as ‘millionaire architects’ trying to buy the building, who turned out to be frauds. Controversy has surrounded the piece since its arrival, leaving the landlord inundated with ‘malicious messages’ from locals desperate to keep it in the town. He added: ‘Some busybody from Cheltenham even came up with this idea that I didn’t own that part of the house. 'There’s not a ""pretty strong certainty"" that I own it - it is certain that I do. I take a bit of umbrage with people getting involved with my business when it’s nothing to do with them. ‘I’ve had substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork - and if it was about money for me I’d have sold it by now.’ After listed status was granted last month, the council's case officer Martin Chandler said: 'It will be afforded a greater level of protection than it has currently. 'But it doesn't mean we won't be faced with future applications to consider other changes to it. It [planning consent] doesn't automatically mean it's going to be retained in situ.'

136,"A mysterious object has been spotted flying through an Argentinian news broadcast, leading to claims of a UFO. The disc-shaped object was seen moving across a studio backdrop during a live broadcast in Buenos Aires last week. However, several outlets and experts are dismissing the claims of a UFO, pointing out several errors in the short clip. 'Mysterious object': The disc-shaped object can be spotted in the top-left corner of the background . The object was seen moving across what is purported to be a large widow during a studio broadcast from Todo Noticias, aka TN, an Argentinian cable news channel. As the anchors discuss a topic on the daily agenda, a disc-shaped object is seen zooming across the skyline in the background. The 'UFO' was first reported by MysteriousUniverse.org, who writes that the broadcast took place on February 28th before it was posted on Youtube. Unfortunately for alien enthusiasts, there are several indications that the UFO is nothing but a hoax. Several anomalies in the short clip indicates that the background in the studio has been tampered with. UFO? The object zooms across the skyline in the background behind the broadcasters . Myth debunked: The Argentinian UFO has been dismissed as a fake by experts, who has pointed out several flaws in what they call an 'animation hoax' Pie in the sky: The disc-shaped UFO is now in the top left corner having 'flown' behind the skyscraper . 'This was most likely an animation hoax because of some common editing errors that appear to be present,' Ben Hansen, the former lead investigator of the Syfy Channel's 'Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files', told the Huffington Post. Raëlism, also known as Raelianism or the Raëlian movement, is a UFO religion that was founded in 1974. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human and when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans they made, they previously misinformed (on purpose) early humanity that they were angels, cherubim or gods. Raëlians believe messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha,Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. Hansen highlights two particular errors, one being proof that the UFO is superimposed on top of wires on an antenna mast at the 33-second mark, and the second that the UFO disappears before it supposedly flies behind a building. He also highlights that if the station really had captured a flying alien vessel, he believes they would have either mentioned it during the live broadcast or used it later for publicity. This comes just  a week after another alleged UFO spotting during a South American broadcast. The production crew in Lima, Peru, were filming a programme when they interrupted it in order to  focus on what appears to be a 'UFO' hovering over the city. The purple-colored disc-shaped object can be seen hovering in the  sky near a construction site, but so far, there has been no official explanation for the object. Thousands of people have taken to social media to discuss what they think the mysterious purple object is and the video has already been viewed more than 100,000 times.","'UFO' seen in flying over Buenos Aires skyline during news broadcast .

139,"The Tories could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it, Government chief whip Michael Gove admitted last night. Mr Gove, the former education secretary, said he could not rule out further cuts to child benefit to reduce the deficit. Asked on the BBC's Newsnight if he could confirm that there would be 'no more changes to child benefit', Mr Gove said: 'No I can't say that.' Conservative chief whip Michael Gove admitted the Tories could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it . Mr Gove said the Tories would not cut benefits for the disabled or pensioners – but refused to rule out cuts to child benefit. He said: 'There is a huge amount of welfare spending that can be reduced without having any impact on people who have disabilities. 'We're not going to hit, or take money away from, the disabled. We're going to protect people who are pensioners. What we are going to do.' Mr Gove was asked specifically: 'There will be no more changes to child benefit. Can you say that to us?' He said: 'It's not our policy at the moment. But the thing I would say is that we've succeeded over the course of the last five years, not just in making departmental cuts which I've alluded to, but in making £21billion worth of welfare cuts. All we're asking to do is to do half of that again.' Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'Michael Gove's repeated refusal to rule out child benefit cuts will only add to fears that the Tories have a secret plan to cut support to children. 'The Tories have a £12 billion black hole in their welfare plans it's clear they can't fill without hitting families with children. It's time for the Tories to come clean with the public about their plans to cut child benefit.' The revelation comes after George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term. Asked on the BBC's Newsnight if he could confirm there will be 'no more changes to child benefit', Mr Gove said: 'No I can't say that' Mr Gove's remarks came after  George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term . More than a million households lost out when the Coalition announced that families with one parent earning £50,000 would pay tax on child benefit. Earners over £60,000 lost out altogether. The controversial measure, brought in two and a half years ago as part of the Government's austerity programme, was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers. It meant anyone earning less than £50,000 – even a couple on £49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £20.70 a week for the first child, and £13.70 for every subsequent child. Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could 'rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you've already done in this Parliament?' But the Chancellor appeared to leave the door open to further cuts when asked if he would be 'depriving more families' of the payments which are worth more than £1,000 per year. Mr Osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold, only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system Universal Credit, which is being rolled out nationally. The respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that increasing Universal Credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £4.8billion a year. The Chancellor said: 'You can judge us on our record in this Parliament. If we wanted to put child benefit into Universal Credit we would have done it when we set up Universal Credit. 'We've got a track record, we've got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay, sharpening work incentives.' Asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts, he said: 'I've given you a very clear answer. We've created a welfare system where child poverty is down, inequality is down, we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable. 'We are going to carry on doing that in the next Parliament. But we can't do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy.' The Conservatives say they would cut £30billion of spending if they win a second term. Of this £12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill, with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance. While the Prime Minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension, few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family's annual benefits from £26,000 to £23,000. It is widely speculated that the Conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children, to save around £2billion a year.","Asked if he could rule out child benefit cuts Mr Gove said: 'I can't say that'

142,"Jailed: Carrie Russel, 26, was put in a Japanese prison for possessing Adderall - which is illegal in Japan . A teacher from Oregon has been freed from a Japanese jail after being locked up for three weeks for possessing the prescription drug Adderall. Carrie Russell, 26, was arrested on February 20 after admitting to police that she had been sent a stash of Adderall pills in the mail. The medicine, prescribed by her doctor back home, is common in the United States, but banned in Japan. She was let out of jail on Tuesday after U.S. government officials, including Caroline Kennedy, daughter of President Kennedy and the current ambassador to Japan, negotiated her release. Russell's mother, a doctor, posted the a three-month supply of the pills to an address in South Korea, from which Russell forwarded them to her home in Nagoya, Japan, according to The Oregonian. Police tracked her down to a restaurant and arrested her while she was dining with friends. She knew just four words of Japanese. Russell, who had a job in Nagoya teaching English, told the newspaper she was taken to a detention center with Japanese cellmates and given chores to do. She said the facility was 'not anything terrifying'. She said she was fed Bento box meals in women's prison, where guards tried to speak with her in English and she picked up more Japanese. Arrest: Police tracked Russell down to a restaurant after learning she had brought a three-month supply of Adderall pills into the country. She knew just four words of Japanese when she was arrested . In the meantime, members of Congress, the Japanese embassy, and even the White House were reportedly involved in intense negotiations to set her free - despite the Japan's harsh anti-amphetamine laws, which often carry lengthy jail sentences. The details of the negotiations are not clear, but Kennedy, who made the case a priority, managed to convince local prosecutors not to file charges, and to let her go. Russell's family wrote an apologetic letter to the Japanese government, saying she had never intended to break the law. In a statement announcing her release, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) proclaimed that 'common sense has won the day'. Negotiations: Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, helped secure Russell's release. She is pictured above with the governor of Tokyo in December 2014 . He continued: 'I want to thank Ambassador Kennedy and her staff for working closely with our office and their Japanese counterparts to get her released.'

She said: 'In spite of this, I love Japan'.

143,"A man who has fathered 34 children with 17 different women has landed his own reality series, which is due to start airing on Oprah Winfrey's OWN network in September. Jay Williams, from Atlanta, previously featured in an episode of Iyanla: Fix My Life, another of the channel's hit shows, which sees spiritual life coach Iyanla Vanzant, trying to help different people all struggling with various aspects of their lives. The untitled new series will follow the seemingly irresponsible father as he tries to establish new connections with his children, who are thought to be aged between three and 27, and their mothers. Scroll down for video . Father of many: Jay Williams (pictured) has fathered 34 children, who are thought to range in age from three to 27, with 17 women . Bad dad: The video producer appeared on OWN series Iyanla: Fix My Life in September last year (pictured) A spokesperson from OWN said this 'extreme situation' will challenge Jay's intentions to live up to his responsibilities. Any fans of Iyanla's show couldn't fail to recognize Jay - who was one of the series' most controversial characters. When the video producer appeared on the show in September last year, he was lambasted by the life coach for failing to undergo a vasectomy - despite fathering so many children, who had, as of October 2014, already made him a grandfather three times. 'So let me ask you this question, Jay,' Iyanla said during the episode. '34 children. At any point, did it dawn on you this is too much?' The straight-talking life coach also forced Jay to sit down with four of his children and explain to them why he had 'dropped them' and failed to live up to his responsibilities as a father. 'I would like to confess that I absolutely did not love or care for myself at all,' he explained to the group of four. Tough love: The straight-talking life coach demanded that Jay own up to the mistakes that he has made, both as a father and as a man . No trust: Four of Jay's children appeared on the show (pictured) when their father tried to offer up an explanation for his behavior and apologize for not being there for them . 'I have not honored your mothers as women the way that I should have. I would never say willingly, but I absolutely fell short on my responsibilities to you as a provider, at times. 'And the biggest thing that I would like to confess is that I absolutely did not live up to be the true man that I am and the father that you really have. I am responsible for the reason why each and every one of you absolutely don't know me.' But despite Jay insisting that his sentiments were completely and utterly heart-felt, it seemed his sentiments came too little too late for some of his children. 'I just want you to know that I really don't care anymore,' one of his daughters told him. 'I'm just not buying it.' Ironically, despite admitting to fathering numerous children, Jay insisted to Iyanla throughout the show that he did use condoms - and even added that, had he chosen not to use contraception, he 'probably would have had 200 kids'. Indeed, Jay went as far as to say that he was 'happy' about the number of children that he had fathered, remarking that he hadn't chosen to get a vasectomy because he 'didn't want one'.","Jay Williams, from Atlanta, previously featured on an episode of the channel's hit series Iyanla: Fix My Life .

144,"Yingying Dou ran the essay writing site MyMaster . Up to 70 students face expulsion from Australia's leading universities after being found guilty of cheating by paying a company to write their assignments. Two students from the University of Newcastle have already been expelled and more are facing disciplinary action at four other intuitions after being identified as using the MyMaster company which wrote essays for Chinese international students, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Chinese-born Yingying Dou, 30, reportedly ran the website which charged up to $1000 per assignment and was used by hundreds of students across 12 NSW universities. Ms Dou reportedly had 100 employees working from a Chinatown office on George Street in Sydney before the website was shut down. It was claimed that MyMaster had an annual turnover of $160,000 thanks to international students desperate to pass their courses or too lazy to do the work themselves. The University of Newcastle confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that it had conducted internal investigations and in addition to the two expulsions it suspended eight international students and found 21 others guilty of misconduct. The majority of students found guilty were given fail grades for 2014 subjects. Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website MyMaster website which has now been taken down . Two students from the University of Newcastle have been expelled and eight have been suspended . The four other worst-hit universities told the Herald they were still conducting investigations with accused students – including three at the University of Sydney, 11 at University of Technology Sydney, 19 at University of NSW, and 43 at Macquarie University. The maximum penalty for academic misconduct is expulsion at all institutions except UNSW, where it is suspension. UTS Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Shirley Alexander told the ABC: 'I'm not as surprised as you might think. In higher-education we've had to up the ante in how students are changing the methods of cheating for some time.' She said that the news that flyers advertising the MyMaster essay writing service were posted in UTS toilets was not alarming. 'We find those kinds of things all the time, that's not something that is new,' she said. 'When we find them we do take the number and call them and point out how illegal it is but they do appear all the time that's not something new,' she explained. Students (a stock photo is shown) reportedly paid up to $1000 for their essays to be written for them . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a flyer posted at the University of Technology Sydney said: 'Are you racking your brains on your school work? Do you worry about spending $3000 retaking tuition on the failing subject? Leave your worries to MyMaster and make your study easier!' Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website. The company's Facebook page has also been removed but a holding page shows 605 previously people 'liked' it. She reportedly also runs Yingcredible Tutoring, a page which she has endorsed from her own personal Facebook account. 'We provide commerce subjects tutoring service to university students to help them pass the course,' a description on the page reads. Daily Mail Australia contacted Ms Dou for comment but did not responded. Most university websites display clear advice about plagiarism. The University of Sydney says that while nobody commences their studies with the intent to plagiarise 'many people do, for a variety of reasons'. 'Some students plagiarise because they don't fully understand what plagiarism is, why it is wrong and how it can be avoided. Others plagiarise, because of time or other pressures,' a warning on their website reads. Up to 70 students face expulsion from Australia's leading universities after being found guilty of cheating by paying the company to write their assignments . When handing in work students must satisfy the notion that it is 'all your own work'. Students who have used the MyMaster website could be found guilty of 'dishonest plagiarism', which is when they 'knowingly presenting another person's work as one's own work without appropriate acknowledgement of the source'. And 'engage another person to produce or conduct research for the work, including for payment or other consideration'. A spokesperson for the University of Sydney told Daily Mail Australia: 'The University of Sydney is unequivocally opposed to academic dishonesty, including plagiarism and fraudulent authorship, and takes seriously any allegations of academic misconduct. Breaches of academic honesty are not tolerated at the University of Sydney.' 'Failure to adhere to the University's high standards of academic merit, intellectual rigour, and ethical behaviour constitutes a breach of the University's Code of Conduct for Students and Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism in Coursework Policy. If proven, academic dishonesty may constitute misconduct, resulting in serious penalties that may include failure or exclusion. 'The University thoroughly investigates all cases of alleged academic dishonesty and provides education and support to assist students to observe the rules of honest scholarship,' they added.","Yingying Dou, 30, reportedly ran the website called MyMaster .

A grandfather has been banned from entering any Sainsbury's store in Britain - because he accidentally drove his mobility scooter into another shopper. Albert Carter received a letter from the supermarket chain stating police would be called if he is seen in any of its 1,200-plus stores again as he would be  a 'trespasser'. The 80-year-old had gone into a branch of Sainsbury's in Newcastle-under-Lyme to buy a packet of cigarettes on March 7. He accidentally hit a woman with his scooter after paying and paramedics were called to the store. They took the shopper to hospital as a precaution. Mr Carter also struck a customer service desk with his scooter as he panicked following the collision with the female shopper. He received the letter outlining his ban less than a week later. The former truck driver said he has been made to feel like a 'shoplifter' following the mishap and added that it was the first accident he has been involved in on his scooter. He said: 'I understand that they might be concerned about me coming into the shop after what happened but I have never had an accident on it before so why would they ban me forever? 'It was my fault. I take the blame completely. After I paid at the front kiosk I turned to leave and then don't know how it happened. 'I didn't do it on purpose but it was that quick I'm not sure how I hit the women. I was really upset that I hurt someone. 'The staff and paramedics were nice at the time so I don't understand why I have been sent this letter. I have never been a shoplifter so why are they treating me like one? A letter sent by the store manager to the 80-year-old a week after the incident said that if he did enter a Sainsbury's he would be treated as a 'trespasser' 'I want to apologise to the lady. I am really upset to have hurt her. 'Even if I was let into Sainsbury's I'm not sure I would want to go in again after the way they treated me. I have barely left home since the incident.' The letter stated: 'The invitation to enter and shop at all Sainsbury's stores is permanently withdrawn due to the incident you were involved in. 'Should you enter any of our premises, you will be treated as a trespasser and the police will be called as necessary.' The father-of-three's daughter Jayne Taylor, from Chesterton, Staffordshire, has hit out at the supermarket for the ban, which she claims is normally reserved for shoplifters. The 50-year-old, who works as a security guard, said: 'Dad was so upset and distraught at what happened. Mr Carter said: 'Even if I was let into Sainsbury's I'm not sure I would want to go in again after the way they treated me. I have barely left home since the incident' 'We are not denying that he was in the wrong but it was a complete accident, he didn't go into Sainsbury's to plough customers down. 'I'm just flabbergasted he has been treated like a criminal. It's ridiculous. How will they enforce it? 'It's just out of order. He has now lost his confidence and won't go out on the scooter.' A Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'Our teams in store have a duty to consider the safety of all of our customers and this decision was reached after reviewing CCTV footage and other reports. 'We will, of course, be happy to discuss this further with Mr Carter and his family, to ensure that we maintain a safe shopping environment for everyone.' A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman added that the female patient was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital in Hartshill as a precaution and had non-serious injuries.","Albert Carter received letter  after the incident in Newcastle-under-Lyme .

The poster promotes the dazzling Life Ball event, where Conchita will perform, as well as walk in a fashion show staged by Jean Paul Gaultier. Naturally, the 26-year-old wears a lavish gown in the imagery. The gold dress, which is embroidered with over 12,000 Swarovski crystals and 0.5kg of pearls and painted with 2.5kg of gold color, took over 1,000 hours to handcraft. Conchita posed before industry heavyweight Ellen von Unwerth's lens for the poster . Life Ball founder, Gery Keszler, Conchita, legendary snapper Ellen and Jean Paul Gaultier pose on set . 'Being able to wear this art piece of a dress felt sensational,' gushed Conchita. 'I love Ellen! I knew a few of her works and was incredibly excited to meet her. What a great women.' Speaking about her work, Ellen Von Unworth said: 'I tried to imitate Klimt's painting - it almost felt flagrant. I love Klimt, his paintings with all those colors, all this glamor and and all the poetry. I felt very inspired by creating an homage to this extraordinary painting.' The Life Ball posters, which are created by world famous artists and convey the event's message, have become legendary since their launch in 2013. The poster will be auctioned off on the day of the Ball during the AIDS Solidarity Gala in the Hofburg palace for the benefit of Austrian and international HIV/AIDS projects. In 2014, the auction of the original photo by David La Chapelle sold for £130,000. Conchita, seen behind the scenes on set, won over the globe after winning Europe's biggest entertainment contest in 2014 . The Life Ball, which takes place in May, is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV/AIDS and is being dubbed Europe's answer to the MET Ball thanks to it's dazzling guestlist. Speaking about the origins of the glittering event, Keszler told FEMAIL: 'Life Ball was born out of the energy and environment prevalent across the world in the late 80’s and early 90’s - particularly in the fashion industry - that saw AIDS as a daily issue profoundly effecting our friends and colleagues who were dying, but that no one understood or was willing to talk about. 'There was this undercurrent of urgency to do something: to help, to get involved and make some noise. 'My main goal with the first Life Ball was to bring a spotlight to the disease, the fundraising aspect was a secondary consideration.' The Life Ball, pictured, is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV or AIDS and is being dubbed Europe's answer to the MET Ball . Gery Keszler set up the event in 1992 with the goal of the show being to be provocative and have HIV/AIDS and the taboo that it represented acknowledged. Right: Conchita as the star of this year's poster . Gery Keszler, left, pictured with Sir Elton John, centre, set up The Life Ball in 1992 to raise vital funds . The event, which has attracted the likes of Bill Clinton, left, and Dame Vivienne Westwood, aims to get people talking about AIDS, which Keszler says was a daily issue profoundly effecting his friends and colleagues who were dying but that no one understood or was willing to talk about . Keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific Ball tradition that they have in Vienna, and combine the splendour of the Viennese Waltz with modern, liberal ideals to celebrate life. 'At that time, the goal of the show was to be provocative as we were aiming to cause a stir and have HIV/AIDS and the taboo that it represented acknowledged,' he explained. 'When in 1993 one of my clients, Thierry Mugler’s main stylist, died of the disease, he agreed to do the fashion show and so Life Ball as a standalone event was born. 'I had no conceivable idea what I was taking on, it was me and a fax machine in six square meters of office space in my client's kitchen. I funded it entirely from my own pocket and didn’t really know if anyone was going to attend but knew that we had to do something.' Keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific Ball tradition that they have in Vienna with more liberal ideas (Conchita Wurst pictured at the event) Prince Harry, who set up Sentebale, a charity that provides healthcare and education to vulnerable children in Lesotho, Southern Africa, will be honoured with an award for his services . As part of his Sentebale charity, Harry built the Mamohato Children's Centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education and the initiative is being awarded . Keszler says this year's Life Ball, which takes place in Vienna, will 'undoubtedly be better than ever' Keszler 'strongly believes' that a cure for HIV is on the horizon and hopes to make as much noise about it as possible via his glittering event . From there, a huge event was born and the likes of Debbie Harry, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen were among the first guests. The event is now listed as one of the top 50 HIV/AIDS fundraisers in the world and has partnered with Elton John’s AIDS Foundation, Bill Clinton’s AIDS Initiative and AmFAR. Keszler says this year’s Life Ball will 'undoubtedly be better than ever'. The event will be continuing its work with Elton John’s foundation, supporting the crucial work that they do, and Graham Norton will be attending as part of the foundation. Adding some high fashion glamour to the event, Jean Paul Gaultier is set to unveil an exclusive retrospective of work twenty years after he first showed there. With gold as this year’s Life Ball theme, taking inspiration from the exquisite baroque Vienna Secessionists, the couture show will follow the vibrant and ostentatious theme with a bevy of internationally acclaimed supermodels set to walk for well-connected Jean Paul. 'It is really perfect timing to have JPG back this year,' said Keszler. 'It has been twenty years since he was part of the Life Ball and we are at such an exciting time in our medical fight against HIV that his presence is a wonderful reminder of how far we have come.' The event is now listed as one of the top 50 HIV AIDS fundraisers in the world and has attracted guests such as Maria Cross, left, and Antonio Banderas and Naomi Campbell, right . Ricky Martin has performed at the event in previous years and 2015 will welcome Jean Paul Gaultier and Charlize Theron . Jean Paul's show will be watched from the front row by actress Charlize Theron, who will attend on behalf of her foundation Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project. Theron will join a bevy of A-list celebrities and performers, who pour into Vienna annually to help fight against HIV at the world’s largest AIDS event. The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, based in her home country of South Africa, is dedicated to addressing HIV/AIDS in adolescents across sub-Saharan Africa through education, grant giving, networking and community outreach. Theron will give a keynote speech at the First Ladies Luncheon at the Belvedere Castle in Vienna ahead of attending the Life Ball, where she will present the work of her organisation and her vision for and AIDS-free generation. Prince Harry, who works tirelessly to help vulnerable children living in extreme poverty at risk of AIDS, will also be recognised. As part of his Sentebale charity, which he set up with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, the 30-year-old royal built the Mamohato Children’s Centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education. And  Harry's programme will be receiving the 2015 Swarovski Crystal Of Hope Award at the glittering Life Ball event in May. Keszler won't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change . Keszler 'strongly believes' that a cure for HIV is on the horizon and that the leap forward that was affordable generic medication was crucial to the fight for survival for the 34 million people in the world living with HIV. 'Ironically we have further to go in the fight against social AIDS than we do the medical disease now and thus it is this fight that we must be equally concerned with,' he said. But that's where the Life Ball comes in - and he won't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change. He concludes: 'Life Ball is symbolic, it is a unique weekend in the year in which the world’s most significant AIDS organisations come together, stand together, fight together and continue to fight for those who are not able to fight for themselves. 'It is my constant desire for Life Ball weekend to expand, to obtain more friends, have better connections, help more programmes and become internationally known for fighting social AIDS as well as the disease itself.'","Conchita is star of Life Ball 2015 poster .

149,"Four-month-old baby Evan Summerfield, who died from meningitis, just hours after laughing for the very first time . A family have been left devastated after their four-month-old baby died from meningitis just 12 hours after laughing for the very first time. Evan Summerfield from Devon had just learned how to giggle and take his dummy out by himself but just hours later he was fighting for his life. The youngster had woken from a nap with a rash stretching from his head to his belly-button. And when his great-grandmother carried out the 'glass test', she saw that it didn't fade under pressure. He was rushed to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth but despite doctors and nurses battling to save him, Evan was diagnosed with meningoccal septicaemia and died soon after. His death has devastated his parents Shannon Summerfield, 17, and Kris Adams, 19, who have been left confused as to how he could fall ill so quickly. Evan's grandmother Sarah Summerfield, 38, said: 'We're so confused how fast this horrible, nasty illness just takes hold. 'One moment he was laughing and smiling and then, it seems like in a heartbeat, he was so cruelly taken away.' Evan was born on November 3 last year and was just four-months-old when he took ill with a high temperature while staying with his great grandparents. His grandmother explained: 'They took him to the doctors and that was the first and last time he laughed. It's like he left it for us. 'The doctor said he had a virus and gave him Calpol and Nurofen, and said if it gets worse he should come straight back. 'They went home and put him to bed and he was fine, but in the morning he had a rash from the top of his head to his belly button. 'My mum did the glass test and called 999 - she was so quick-thinking - it would be easy to think it was chicken pox.

Now family friend Charlie McManus has set up a fund-raising page to help pay for Evan’s funeral, and help ease some of the family’s heartbreak. The family wanted to thank everyone for their donations, and have seen more than £1,000 given for Evan’s funeral.

According to Greater Manchester Police no arrests were made at the scene because officers intervened before any damage was inflicted on the clamp. It is understood that the motorist had a two-stroke petrol-powered Stihl saw with a metal cutting disc. The DVLA has the power to immediately clamp or impound any car if it is not properly taxed. Car owners can notify authorities if they are not using the car and sign statutory declaration that the car is off the road. However, if they sign the declaration and continue to use the car, it can be seized. Motorists who have been clamped by the DVLA have to provide evidence that they have taxed their car before it can be released. If a car has not been taxed, the motorist will have to pay a 'surety' deposit of £700 to have it released. According to the DVLA the cost of having a clamp removed increases the longer the car is immobilised. If a driver refuses to pay, the DVLA will destroy or sell the car to recoup some of the costs.

163,"There are many ways to be labelled 'A bad girl' in the UK, including stealing from the tuck-shop, cheating in an exam and smoking behind the bike sheds. But in India, the bar for being a disappointment to society is much, much lower. A group of students from the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology in Bangalore made a tongue-in-cheek poster detailing the qualities a young women needs in India to be considered 'bad'. The poster by students at the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology in Bangalore details things that a bad girl does in India . The project came about after the pupils were given an assignment to contrast different images from popular culture. They decided to base a poster on an Indian old print from the 1980's that listed the good things an 'Ideal Boy' does, including 'greeting your parents', 'eat meals on time' and 'get up early'. In contrast, the new poster made by the students shows that a bad girl 'can't make round rotis', 'has breasts', and 'falls in love in a park.' The group also made a poster that lists things that bad girls own, including a pregnancy test, condoms and cigarettes, but some of the items are far more innocent, including an iPhone, lipstick, and a short skirt. They also created a posted that detailed the items a bad girl owns . The assignment was given by teacher Alison Byres, who told the Wall Street Journal that her her students regularly bring up the topic of a 'Bad Girl' in her classes nowadays. She said: 'It seems like there’s nothing you can do to be the perfect girl because being a girl itself appears to be the problem.' The poster was based on a 1980s poster that detailed everything an ideal boy does . Student Furqan Jawed, who originally posted the image to Facebook said he was shocked by the attention it has received so far. He told BBC Trending: 'We did not mean it to become social propaganda. 'It was done as part of an assignment.' The poster comes just a few weeks after a woman who uploaded a brutally honest 'Marriage CV' to the internet after discovering her parents had posted a profile of their daughter on a dating site. Indhuja Pillai, 23, from Bangalore, couldn't believe her eyes when she saw the account that her well-meaning parents had created in order to find her a husband.

164,"Lord Warner, pictured, has accused the Labour party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care . ED Miliband’s pledge to rein in NHS ‘privatisation’ by capping profits of firms providing care has come under fierce attack from a former Labour health minister. As Labour made the NHS the central issue of its election campaign launch, Lord Warner accused his party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care. He said competition between different providers was vital to ensure the NHS can cope with spikes in demand, which occur most winters. ‘It is very difficult for the NHS to cope with the peaks and troughs of demand without the involvement of the private sector,’ he said. Kicking off his campaign at the site of the 2012 London Olympics in east London, Mr Miliband said the election ‘may come down to the wire’, though his deputy Harriet Harman insisted Labour was already ‘within touching distance of victory’. His main policy announcement was that Labour would halt what he called a ‘tide of privatisation’ in the NHS. Firms brought in to provide free treatment to patients would be hit with a five per cent profit cap, he said. Labour said the cap would apply to all NHS contracts worth £500,000 or more. Any company that made more than five per cent from the contract would be forced to reimburse the NHS for any returns above the level of the cap. Local NHS commissioners would have the power to allow higher profits in exceptional circumstances, if approved by NHS England or the Health Secretary. The cap would not apply to GPs, pharmacies or dentists. Mr Miliband repeated his pledge to introduce a ‘mansion tax’ on expensive homes, impose a levy on the tobacco companies and close tax loopholes exploited by hedge funds. The £2.5 billion raised would pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more doctors, 5,000 new care workers, and 3,000 more midwives, he said. Claiming another five years of Conservative government would mean ‘the disintegration of our public services’, Mr Miliband added: ‘We’ll scrap David Cameron’s market framework for the NHS and stop the tide of privatisation. ‘The NHS will be the preferred provider. No company working with the NHS will be able to profit by cherry picking: rejecting patients with the more complex and expensive needs for their own advantage.‘And, for the first time, we will cap the profits that private health companies can make from our National Health Service. ‘The standard rule will be a five per cent cap. Because the money we pay for our health care should be invested for patient care, not for excess profits for private firms.’ Miliband kicked off his campaign at the site of the 2012 London Olympics in east London . Critics accuse party of hypocrisy, since expenditure on NHS services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before, when Labour was in power. Overall, around just six pence in every pound is spent in the NHS with the private sector, compared to just under five pence under Labour. Labour insists that the Government’s NHS reforms have accelerated the number private firms winning NHS contracts, with around one in three now going outside the health service. Lord Warner, a health minister between 2003 and 2007, pointed out Labour had expanded the use of private sector providers in the NHS – and insisted it could not now survive without them. Of Mr Miliband’s profit cap, he told the Daily Mail: ‘It runs the risk of being one of these pre-election promises which doesn’t stand up when confronted with the reality of government. ‘It’s far from clear how you would actually implement it. A lot of the private sector is currently providing services to the NHS at standards NHS tariffs. Is that a profit? Miliband's main policy announcement was that Labour would halt what he called a ‘tide of privatisation’ in the NHS (file picture) ‘If you want to scare people, you can scare people. But all the work that was done in the Blair government on choice and competition showed that people didn’t have concerns on whether work was done by the private or public sector. ‘What they were concerned with was whether they would have to pay and was their care safe.' The Labour peer said some senior people in his party appeared overly ‘preoccupied’ with the issue of private sector involvement in the NHS, insisting: ‘It rather misses the point. ‘The point is what’s the best quality of care we can provide for patients at a reasonable price.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘If you bankrupt the economy like Labour did last time – then you’ll put our NHS at risk. We can only have a strong NHS if we have a strong economy, but Ed Miliband doesn’t have an economic plan. ‘We all know Labour want to “weaponise” the NHS but this is another policy from Ed Miliband that looks ill-thought through. It risks higher infection rates, higher waiting times and chaos for our NHS. This incompetence is exactly why Ed Miliband is simply not up to the job. ‘Independent commentators confirm that use of the private sector has grown at half the rate under this government as it did under ,o this is no more than a gimmick to scare people about privatisation that isn’t happening. ‘The real issue for the future of the NHS is how to fund the growing needs of an ageing population, and by tearing up an economic plan that is working Labour would threaten the real increases in funding that Conservatives are promising. No one can deliver a strong NHS without a strong economy.’ Lord Warner, a health minister between 2003 and 2007, pointed out Labour had expanded the use of private sector providers in the NHS – and insisted it could not now survive without them . Dr Leonard Shapiro, a consultant cardiologist at Papworth Hospital NHS Trust, said of the profit cap: ‘Practically implementing something like this is going to be virtually impossible.’ Most private sector bodies work both for the NHS and privately, and pooled costs, he said. ‘To try to figure out how much profit they make from the NHS is going to be nearly impossible. In fact, it may actually cost more money to go through the accounting papers than the amount it will save from making a cap.’ But Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association council, backed Labour.‘Proposals to remove the most damaging elements of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, to support more joined up care and to prevent the private sector from cherry picking the most profitable services are a step in the right direction,’ he said. ‘The BMA wants a publically provided and funded health service, and believes the NHS should always be the preferred provider.’ Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb said: ‘Liberal Democrats in government put an end to Labour's sweetheart deals with the private sector, while the independent King's Fund has poured cold water on Labour's claims about privatisation. ‘Only the Liberal Democrats have a credible plan to invest the £8bn per year by 2020 that NHS bosses say is needed. ‘A private sector profit cap sounds appealing but the devil would be in the detail and a simplistic policy could cause chaos for local hospitals.’ Dr Louise Irvine, of the National Health Action Party, said Labour’s plan ‘doesn’t go far enough’ and an extra £2.5 billion ‘won't stop the NHS from teetering over the cliff-edge’. ‘The bottom line is that Labour's policies will leave the NHS under-resourced and open to continued privatisation, which will make it impossible to provide a comprehensive, high quality, efficient and safe health service,’ she added. ‘A cap on private profits is unworkable. It's easy for private companies to arrange their tax affairs so as to avoid registering profits. For example, Virgin do not currently record a profit in the UK on their NHS contracts.‘Labour's commitments on the NHS are lukewarm and tinkering around the edges.’","Miliband has been accused of scaremongering and risking patient care .

The man had handcuffed the deputy and held both officers at gunpoint with their own weapons before the wildlife officer overpowered him, took back his gun and shot him to death Monday near the small town of Dinosaur in northwestern Colorado, about 10 miles from the Utah border. Neither officer was injured during the encounter that began after they found the couple's abandoned Ford Explorer on the side of the road. Outlaws: Georgie Hand, 43, faces charges of attempted first degree murder, second degree kidnapping, aggravated robbery among other charges. Her husband, James Damon, 46, was shot and killed by police . Georgie Hand, 43, faces charges including attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery and disarming a peace officer. Her husband, James Damon, 46, died at the scene. The police reports provide new details about the harrowing struggle. After finding the SUV, wildlife officer Nathan Martinez followed a set of footsteps to the couple, who were sitting on a hillside. Damon aimed a handgun at Martinez and ordered him to keep his hands up as Hand pulled the officer's weapon from his holster, the reports state. They forced Martinez to sit down and toss his radio onto the ground. Damon asked if he had a wife and kids, finally saying, ''How do we get out of this, how does everybody walk away alive?'' Hand told investigators, according to the reports. Pointing Martinez's own gun at him, the couple then led him down the hill toward Moffat County Deputy Bhrent Shock. Struggle: A Colorado sheriff's deputy and a state wildlife officer were held hostage by a husband and wife before a struggle erupted and the man was fatally shot. The officers have been suspended . Hand told investigators her husband pointed his gun at Shock's face and ordered him to the ground, where Damon stripped him of his gun, radio and stun gun before handcuffing his right hand to his duty belt. Damon then pressed the gun into the back of the deputy's head. Martinez threw the keys to his vehicle toward Damon and told the pair they could take it and go, according to the reports. Hand walked away and Martinez told investigators that Damon ordered the officers to their knees near the Ford. Martinez could see the deputy's handgun in one of Damon's hands and his own weapon in the other. 'At this point, Officer Martinez knew they were going to die, but he wasn't going to die without a fight,' the police report says. He 'made the decision to disarm Damon and get his own handgun back.' Some details of the struggle were hazy. Martinez told investigators he didn't remember at what point the gun fired, but that it malfunctioned before he was finally able to fire a shot into Damon's back. The officers then arrested Hand, who was still holding a handgun. A judge on Wednesday ordered Hand to remain in jail without bond. Court records do not list an attorney who could comment on the allegations against her. Hand told investigators she and Damon had been injecting meth at least once a day throughout the week, according to the reports. The pair were wanted in Wasatch County, Utah, on charges of burglary, theft and forgery, according to court records. They were accused of using a stolen credit card and checks to make thousands of dollars of purchases at a Wal-Mart and elsewhere in December. Authorities in Chaffee County, Colorado, were seeking them on suspicion of stealing credit cards, ski equipment, electronics and other items from cars and pawning them. Chaffee County authorities issued warrants for their arrests in February. Shock and Martinez have been placed on administrative leave, a standard practice after an officer-involved shooting. The district attorney's critical incident response team was investigating.","Georgie Hand, 43, faces charges of kidnapping, disarming a peace officer, felony menacing and aggravated robbery .

173,"A real estate investment trust (REIT) that's considering getting out of the snow business could end up making the largest single ski resort transaction in the sport's history. CNL Lifestyle Properties owns more than a dozen ski resorts from Maine to California that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. If CNL sells all of its 16 properties to one buyer, industry officials say it would be the biggest real estate transaction in the history of skiing. Scroll down for video . CNL Lifestyle Properties owns more than a dozen ski resorts like Sunday River in Maine (pictured above) The 16 resorts the trust owns stretch from Maine to California and they're worth hundreds of millions of dollars . If CNL sells all 16 properties to one buyer,  it would be the biggest real estate deal in the history of skiing . If the firm's resorts - which include Sunday River and Sugarloaf in Maine, Bretton Woods, Loon Mountain and Mount Sunapee in New Hampshire, Okemo Mountain in Vermont, Crested Butte in Colorado, Brighton in Utah, and Northstar-at-Tahoe and Sierra-at-Tahoe in California - do sell, skiers might not even notice because the resort operators' long-term leases will remain in place even if the properties change hands. REITs bring in revenue through rent paid by ski resort operators like Michigan-based Boyne Resorts, which holds long-term leases for Sunday River, Sugarloaf and Loon Mountain. A Boyne official said skiers needn't worry about the potential sale of their beloved ski mountains. Steve Kircher, president of eastern operations for Boyne, said: 'For the skier, it's a nonevent.' CNL Financial Group managing director Steve Rice said the trust will make decisions 'in the near future' Boyne will remain the lease holder, regardless of ski resort ownership, for several more decades. Bob Rogowsky, who skies 70 to 80 days a year at Sunday Rive and recently bought a retirement home in the area, said most skiers are pleased with the investments that have been made since CNL bought the resort and Boyne began running it in 2007. He said: 'I wouldn't have made that kind of financial commitment and lifetime commitment if I didn't believe there was stability and a good future.' Ski resorts, which are at the mercy of weather and the economy, can be good investments as long the owners have a long investment horizon, said Michael Krongel from Mirus Resort Capital. The trust will evaluate options for its remaining properties  'in the near future', according to CNL Financial Group senior managing director Steve Rice. Besides selling its ski resorts, theme parks and marinas, alternatives include a private buyout or listing on a publicly traded exchange. Ideally, the remaining properties would be sold and CNL enlisted investment bank Jefferies LLC to help evaluate options. Rice said: 'We're taking a studied and careful approach.' If the resorts do sell, skiers might not even notice because the operators' long-term leases will remain in place . REITs are an investment vehicle for a variety of properties including hotels, office buildings and malls, but they are new to the ski industry in the last 15 or so years. There's only one other REIT that's a big player in the ski industry besides CNL. CNL Lifestyle Properties was valued at as much as $3billion in 2012 with ownership of more than 100 water parks, ski resorts, marinas and senior housing developments. The trust's value dropped in the aftermath of a real estate downturn. The REIT is nearing the end of its projected lifespan and anticipates having an 'exit strategy' in place by Dec. 31. In June, CNL agreed to sell 48 golf properties for $320million. Then it announced an agreement to sell its senior housing for $790million in December. Besides selling the resorts, alternatives include a private buyout or listing on a publicly traded exchange .","CNL Lifestyle Properties could sell off all the properties it owns in one deal .

179,"New research funded by farmers aims to breed a wheat variety for people who can't eat the  grain, an endeavor that comes as wider consumer interest in gluten-free foods is booming. The Kansas Wheat Commission is spending $200,000 for the first two years of the project, which is meant to identify everything in wheat's DNA sequences that can trigger a reaction in people suffering from celiac disease. The disease is an autoimmune disorder in which eating even tiny amounts of gluten - made up of numerous, complex proteins that gives dough its elasticity and some flavor to baked goods - can damage the small intestine. Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry, said funding research to breed gluten-free wheat is 'the right thing to do' The only known treatment known is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley. Though celiac disease is four-to-five times more common now than 50 years ago, only about one per cent of the world's population is believed to suffer from it, and just a fraction have been diagnosed. But the gluten-free food business has skyrocketed in the last five years, driven in part by non-celiac sufferers who are either intolerant to gluten or following a gluten-free fad diet because they believe it may help them lose weight or that it's somehow healthier. Sales of gluten-free snacks, crackers, pasta, bread and other products reached $973million in the United States in 2014, up from $810million the previous year, according to a January report by consumer research firm Packaged Facts. The research analyzed the sales of hundreds of explicitly labeled and marketed gluten-free products and brands at supermarkets, drugstores, and mass merchandisers. Supporters of the Kansas research, though, say this isn't a way to regain market share. Miller shows a flour solution from a specific strain of wheat at a research facility in the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. The only known treatment for celiac desiseas is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley . The research for gluten-free wheat began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. It is still in its early stages and researchers are looking at proteins inside the grain . 'If you know you are producing a crop that is not tolerated well by people, then it's the right thing to do,' according to the project's lead researcher, Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry. Gluten-free foods are a niche product, and in the broader context of the world's wheat markets, it is not a driving factor, according to Dan O'Brien, extension grain market specialist at Kansas State University. 'I anticipate it will develop as a specialty market,' Miller said.The research, which began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas, is still in its early stages, with researchers extracting proteins from seeds of various varieties of wheat. Miller has yet to begin work combining the proteins with antibodies produced by the human immune system to test for reactions. He also plans to examine the wild relatives of wheat as well as modern varieties, and will tap into a Kansas wheat variety repository that dates back to the 1900s in hopes of finding a variety - perhaps one that fell out of favor among commercial farmers - that might already be low in reactivity for celiac sufferers. Researchers hope to use that variety to develop a gluten-free wheat using traditional breeding methods. Miller's methodology might be 'too simplistic an approach' that wouldn't identify all the toxic sequences that trigger a celiac reaction, according to Armin Alaedini, assistant professor of medical sciences at Columbia University and a researcher at the New York-based school's Celiac Disease Center. Miller (pictured) plans to look at wild relatives of wheat as well as modern grains. Researchers hope to use these varieties and traditional breeding methods to develop a gluten-free wheat . Alaedini, after looking at Miller's plan online, said the project may end up with a less toxic wheat product that isn't completely safe for all celiac disease patients. 'After all this effort, this product that is coming out... is unlikely to be superior in terms of nutritional value or baking properties and taste to the gluten-free products that are already on the market,' Alaedini said. The medical advisory board for the Celiac Disease Foundation, a nonprofit based in Woodland Hills, California, could not reach a consensus on the viability of Miller's research. But the organization's CEO, Marilyn Geller, is encouraged. Her son had been sick his entire life before being diagnosed with celiac disease at age 15, Geller said, and his father also was later diagnosed. Since the disorder is genetic, her grandchildren will be at risk of getting it. The more the disease is in the public eye, the more physicians are aware of it, she said, and it'll be more likely the federal government would fund research. 'I am certain that there are a large number of people with celiac disease who (like) the idea of being able to eat actual wheat, with the properties of wheat that make the bread nice and fluffy,' she said. 'The idea of having a variety of wheat that they could eat that has those wonderful wheat-like properties would certainly be very interesting for them.' Sales of gluten-free products in the United States increaed last year, reaching $973million in 2014, up from $810million in 2013 .","The research aims to identify things in wheat's DNA sequence that can trigger a reaction from those suffering from celiac disease .

Photos and video have appeared on social media of two young women smiling, posing and snapping photos with large crocodiles at Darwin's Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve. In the video, a woman can be seen to be unfazed by the beast and takes nonchalant snaps mere metres from it's jaws. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flirting with danger, the woman places a vodka bottle in front of the large croc and snaps a photo . A selfie posted on Instagram shows a young women a mere metre from a crocodile at Fogg Dam in Darwin . At one point the woman even places a Crystal Head Vodka bottle just centimetres from the distressed crocodile before he lunges into the air, to which she just laughs. In another case, on Instagram, a woman poses with another large crocodile for a selfie, captioning the image by stating she did not want to get much closer, even though she was just over a metre from its claws. The Northern Territory is littered with signs to warn people of the dangers of crocodiles . The Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory have issued a direct warning to those wanting to snap a selfie with a crocodile. They have warned the public to be 'crocwise' and keep a safe distance of at least 15 metres. The Northern Territory is notorious for its freshwater and saltwater crocodile population, with certain areas averaging 15 crocodiles per kilometre. Salt water crocodiles can grow to five metres in length, weigh 450 kilograms and last year killed more people than any other year with the 'freshies' remaining more timid and fearful. However, this does not rule out the possibility of an attack by a freshwater crocodile, especially with passerby's getting too close for comfort. Just last January, a 12-year-old boy was taken by a crocodile while swimming with friends in a river in Kakadu. As more and more people arrive to take photos, the distressed crocodile wanders back down the bank . And in June a 62-year-old man was taken, also in Kakadu, whilst he was fishing in his boat when a five-metre salt water crocodile launched itself into the boat, grabbing him and dragging him under the water while his distressed family watched from the river bank. Even though the state is riddled with recognisable crocodile warning signs, tourists and locals seem to be downplaying the dangers for that next level selfie.","Selfies have appeared online with young girls posing with huge crocodiles .

181,"Acetaminophen is the main ingredient in the over-the-counter pain reliever Tylenol . Painkillers not only dull physical pain, but they can also dull your emotions. This is according to a new study that claims acetaminophen (paracetamol) - the main ingredient in the over-the-counter pain reliever Tylenol and paracetamol - has the ability to weaken feelings of happiness and sadness. Acetaminophen has been in use for more than 70 years, but this is the first time that this side effect has been discovered. Previous research had shown that acetaminophen works not only on physical pain, but also on psychological pain. This study takes those results one step further by showing that it also reduces how much users actually feel positive emotions, said Geoffrey Durso, lead author at the Ohio State University. 'This means that using Tylenol or similar products might have broader consequences than previously thought,' Durso said. 'Rather than just being a pain reliever, acetaminophen can be seen as an all-purpose emotion reliever.' Baldwin Way, an assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University said people in the study who took the pain reliever didn't appear to know they were reacting differently. 'Most people probably aren't aware of how their emotions may be impacted when they take acetaminophen,' he said. There were two studies of college students. The first involved 82 participants, half of whom took an acute dose of 1000 milligrams of acetaminophen and half who took an identical-looking placebo. They then waited 60 minutes for the drug to take effect. Participants then viewed 40 photographs selected from a database used by researchers around the world to elicit emotional responses. The photographs ranged from the extremely unpleasant, to the neutral and the very pleasant. After viewing each photo, participants were asked to rate how positive or negative the photo was on a scale of -5 (extremely negative) to +5 (extremely positive). Results showed that participants who took acetaminophen rated all the photographs less extremely than did those who took the placebo. The researchers don't know if other pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin have the same effect, although they plan on finding out in future research . They then viewed the same photos again and were asked to rate how much the photo made them feel an emotional reaction. Researchers are not exactly sure how Ty . The researchers don't know if other pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin have the same effect, although they plan on studying that question. Acetaminophen, unlike many other pain relievers, is not a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID. That means it not thought to control inflammation in the body. Whether that fact has any relevance to possible emotional effects of the drugs is still an open question, the researchers added. In this study, acetaminophen may have tapped into the sensitivity that makes some people react differently to both positive and negative life events. 'There is accumulating evidence that some people are more sensitive to big life events of all kinds, rather than just vulnerable to bad events,' Durso said. Results showed that participants who took acetaminophen rated all the photographs less extremely than did those who took the placebo. 'People who took acetaminophen didn't feel the same highs or lows as did the people who took placebos,' Way said. One possibility is that acetaminophen changes how people judge magnitude. Scientists claim acetaminophen may blunt individuals' broader judgments of everything, not just things having emotional content. The researchers did a second study in which they had 85 people view the same photos and make the same judgments of evaluation and emotional reactions as in the prior study. Participants in this second study also reported how much blue they saw in each photo. Once again, individuals who took acetaminophen had emotional reactions to both negative and positive photographs that were significantly blunted. But judgments of blue colour content were similar regardless of whether the participants took acetaminophen or not. At this point, the researchers don't know if other pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin have the same effect, although they plan on studying that question. Acetaminophen, unlike many other pain relievers, is not a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID. That means it not thought to control inflammation in the body. Whether that fact has any relevance to possible emotional effects of the drugs is still an open question, the researchers added. In this study, acetaminophen may have tapped into the sensitivity that makes some people react differently to both positive and negative life events. 'There is accumulating evidence that some people are more sensitive to big life events of all kinds, rather than just vulnerable to bad events,' Durso said.","It looked at acetaminophen (paracetamol), the main ingredient in Tylenol .

183,"There have been all manner of World Cup shambles for England since they should have won the 1992 final here in Australia. But never one as bad as this. This, surely, is the worst yet, worse than 1996 when Sri Lanka’s pinch-hitters left them trailing in their wake. Worse, even, than 1999 when England were eliminated from their own World Cup the day before the official song came out. And it is certainly worse than the last three World Cups when we had come to expect England to struggle in the one-day game, particularly in 2007 and last time when the biggest tournament in limited-overs cricket followed the Ashes.

England batsman Moeen lays on the ground after being run out by Bangladesh wicketkeeper Rahim during the World Cup match . The 15-run defeat here by Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval, which confirmed England’s abject surrender, is nothing short of an utter humiliation, an embarrassment that, not for the first time in recent years, leaves them as the laughing stock of world cricket. This was the World Cup that England were supposed to take seriously and prepare thoroughly for. This was the World Cup that the Ashes were moved for, leading to a 5-0 thrashing last winter and all manner of painful recriminations. Yet so far advanced has the one-day game progressed in the last two years since England reached the Champions Trophy final that clearing the calendar and playing only one-day cricket so far this winter has been akin to trying to put a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. England have been able to defeat just Scotland in this tournament and after being thrashed by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka they have now been humbled by a team in Bangladesh who are little more than minnows themselves. This tournament was set up to virtually guarantee the progress of the big eight teams to the quarter-finals. It was almost impossible for England to fail to at least get to the last eight where defeat would have been far from a disgrace. Or so it seemed. Instead this is a defeat that deserves to be considered as a total disgrace. It is one that leaves Peter Moores fighting to salvage his reputation as a credible coach of England and Paul Downton, the man who appointed him, facing huge questions about the big decisions he has made. When the dust settles and England have gone through the motions of their last group match against Afghanistan they must have a searching examination of how they play one-day cricket and how they can possibly catch up with the rest of the world before they host the next World Cup in four years time. It is not just Moores and Downton with much to contemplate. Senior players such as Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson have not provided the proper example needed from senior players in a young team and should retire from one-day cricket to allow a new young vibrant team to be built. And the decision to replace Alastair Cook with Eoin Morgan as one-day captain on the brink of this tournament has backfired, the new leader falling for his fifth duck in his last nine innings just when his team needed him most. Morgan has been given permission to miss England’s first one-day international after this World Cup, against an Ireland team having a far better tournament than England, so he can play in the Indian Premier League. That decision frankly stinks and if Morgan does not want to lead England into a new one-day era then he should give up the job now and let Joe Root, who was seriously considered when Cook was sacked, lead them from now on. Never mind that Jos Buttler almost rescued England after they had fallen to 163 for six chasing 275. And never mind that TV umpire Simon Fry gave an atrocious decision to rule that Chris Jordan had been run out when surely there was doubt over whether his bat had bounced up once he had made his ground.

Moores went into full Graham Taylor mode on the sidelines, raging at the fourth official after a truly awful decision, but in truth England did not deserve to get away with this. They were second best to a tigerish Bangladesh just as they have been worse than second best throughout this tournament. And it all started off so well too. It looked as though England were going to have an easy night when Anderson found the bite and swing that had eluded him in this tournament to take two wickets in his first seven balls. Neither Imrul Kayes nor Tamim Iqbal, the dangerman at the top of the Bangladesh order, could cope as England made a start full of the sort of aggression and purpose that the seriousness of their plight demanded. Yet England could not have expected the resistance and then blossoming strokeplay that came from a batsman who had never made a one-day international century before in Mahmudullah. The drop-in pitch at the re-built Adelaide Oval may have been near perfect for batting but the lack of variety in an England attack that has struggled for penetration in this World Cup allowed Bangladesh to flourish. Mahmudullah found a willing ally in the tiny form of Mushfiqur Rahim, the Bangladeshi ‘mighty atom’ who first faced England as a 16-year-old schoolboy 10 years ago, and together they preyed on England’s nerves. Mahmudullah certainly enjoyed becoming the first Bangladeshi to record a hundred in a World Cup match and while he and Rahim were adding 141 for the fifth wicket a total beyond 300 looked within his side’s reach. That they fell 25 short of that was down to much improved death bowling from England, Chris Jordan in particular showing how it should be done after being preferred to Steven Finn in this winner takes all match. It should have been well within England’s reach but their chase was old-fashioned and flawed with Bell, involved in a schoolboy run out that saw the demise of Moeen Ali, leaving them far too much to do after he had taken 82 balls to reach 63. The dismissals of Bell and Morgan in four balls from Rubel Hossain, faster than any England bowler, left England deep in the mire and even though Buttler, their main glimmer of hope for a better one-day future, hit 65 off 52 balls they ended up 16 short. The brilliant Hossain finished it by bowling both Broad and Anderson in three balls in the penultimate over, leaving Chris Woakes stranded on 42, to spark off wild Bangladeshi celebrations.

184,"The proposed £16million fee that Fiorentina will pay Chelsea to sign Mohamed Salah on a permanent deal in the summer of 2016 is beginning to look like daylight robbery. The 22-year-old condemned Juventus to their first home defeat in 48 matches with his sixth goal in seven games after being allowed to leave Stamford Bridge on loan in February. Salah was used as a bargaining tool for Juan Cuadrado to go in the opposite direction for £23.3m, rising to £27m with bonuses, but has been the more devastating of the two for their new clubs. 'Are you listening, Jose?' Mourinho allowed Mohamed Salah to leave Chelsea on loan to Fiorentina . The front pages of Italian newspapers were dominated by Salah after his two goals against Juventus . Mohamed Salah . 7 games . 6 goals . Juan Cuadrado . 5 games . 0 goals . Salah did not suit Jose Mourinho's style of play and made just two starts in 2014-15. He averaged nine minutes per game between August and January, and the arrival of Cuadrado saw him further kicked to the curb. Mourinho and Salah agreed it was best he get first-team opportunities elsewhere, and Fiorentina's faith has been rewarded . Against Juventus he sent a message to Chelsea by starting a run from his own half in a lethal counter-attack. He outpaced Simone Padoin before beating goalkeeper Marco Storari in the top left corner to make it 1-0 in the 11th minute. Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba were on the same wavelength when they tweeted Salah is 'on fire' and the Egyptian, four years younger than Cuadrado, has plenty of time to improve.

FIORENTINA: Seven appearances, six goals. EGYPT: 35 appearances, 20 goals. On his arrival, Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella announced Salah would have to 'adapt to our football' and that 'this is a league that's different from the Swiss and the English'. Louis van Gaal admitted it could take a year for Manchester United's signings to develop, but no such time frame has been required for Salah. Any suggestion he could not perform against Barclays Premier League teams was dismissed on March 1 when he punished Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League with a quick-witted one-two. And three days later he scored the winner against Inter Milan at the San Siro to earn Fiorentina's first win in that fixture since May 2000.

186,"Derry Mathews will take on Venezuelan knockout artist Ismael Barroso for the interim WBA world title after Richar Abril pulled out of their April 18 date. Abril has been elevated to ‘champion in recess’ with Darleys Perez declared the full champion of the lightweight division. Abril was initially forced to withdraw from his title defence against Mathews in March after coming down with dengue fever from a mosquito bite and he withdrew again this week as he is still reeling from the after-effects of the virus that has left him unable to train. Liverpool's Derry Mathews (left) will go head-to-head with Ismael Barroso for the interim WBA world title . Derry was set to fight Cuban WBA champion Richar Abril but will instead face Barroso on the April 18 date . Mathews expressed his disappointment at losing out on a title shot with Abril, who was twice forced to withdraw through illness . Southpaw Barroso, a frightening puncher from El Tigre, has recorded 16 knockouts from 17 wins in his 19 fights (two draws), with 11 quick wins coming inside the first three rounds. Although Liverpool ace Mathews is disappointed that he won't be facing the champion Abril for the belt, the main consolation for him is that he will still challenge for a version of the world title. And Mathews believes that his higher level of experience: 48 fights over 15 years; 18 championship title fights; 264 career rounds and 20 knockouts from 37 wins, vastly outweighs Barroso’s and will give him the vital edge over the South American hitman. ‘It’s unfortunate that Abril’s pulled out again, but things in life happen for a reason and I’m delighted to still be fighting for a version of the WBA world title and I’m headlining the Echo Arena in front of my home fans,’ he said. In his absence WBA lightweight champion Abril (right) has been elevated to ‘champion in recess’ ‘I’ve seen some footage of him, he’s strong, with big right hands and left hooks and and can take you clean out, but I’m not going to be in a position to let him do that to me. ‘Barroso’s a very dangerous fighter and a massive, massive, puncher. Just look at his record, he’s banging people out left, right and centre and it makes frightening reading, but when I saw it I said straight away I’ll have this guy because I know that I can beat him. ‘I’ve been in this sport for over ten years; I’ve had more knockouts than he’s had fights; twice as many fights as him, and three times as many championship fights, in terms of experience he’s not on my level and I can use all of my experience to my advantage. ‘Even with the change of opponent at this stage, plus the change from Abril’s orthodox style to Barrosa’s southpaw style, we still have some time to study him and my trainer Danny Vaughn is confident we can come up with the plan to beat him. I’ll beat anyone at the moment with the way I’m feeling. ‘I’m in with a massive puncher, but I can punch a bit myself so the crowd will be in for an exciting fight and I can see me flattening him. If the opportunity comes to take him out early I’ll take it, but I know I’ve got to be smart in there.’","Derry Mathews will fight Ismael Barroso for the interim WBA world title .

188,"In the history of human invention, there's nothing that matches the car. We rely on them every day. To do our jobs, drop the kids off at school, or take an elderly relative shopping. Cars mean freedom and independence, and most importantly of all, convenience. But years of crazy parking rules have made many law-abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals, and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses. We all know the story. You return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen. Or maybe you run a local shop, and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee. Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (left) and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (right) have vowed to end the 'war on the motorist' with their new 'common sense' approach . In 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end. That meant not only changing the rules, but changing attitudes, because under the previous Government councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny, treating them like cash machines on wheels. This included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives. Where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post. If you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine, or an angry bailiff knocking on your door. And all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by Parliament. Residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence. The minister says they want to see 'fairness and balance' restored to the system so parking no longer generates profit . These rules have now been changed during this parliament. Local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area, including charges and the use of yellow lines. Parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued. They have also vowed to end the industrial use of CCTV 'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking . We are bringing back common sense. Very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute 'grace periods' for council-controlled parking, whether it's on or off-street, paid or free. It means you won't get fined for being a few minutes late. We're also ending the industrial use of CCTV 'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking. The new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post, but ensure public safety as CCTV will still be used to protect schools, bus lanes and red routes. Why have we done this? Because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system. As a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we're cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs. And in another victory for common sense parking at an out-of-order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay. There are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they've done nothing wrong. We'll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you, you'll receive a 25% discount even if the appeal is lost. These changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too. People supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce. Under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring. We're ending this pointless war on motorists so that you don't feel like a criminal just for parking your car.","Move comes from Eric Pickles and transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin .

189,"Manny Pacquiao received a surprise visit from drug testers prior to his Fight of the Century with Floyd Mayweather. Pacquiao was approached unannounced by an anti-doping examiner at the house he is renting in Los Angeles where he is preparing to face Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2. Both fighters can expect to be tested under the US Anti-Doping Association programme to which they have both signed up. Manny Pacquiao was paid a surprise visit by an anti-doping examiner on Sunday to take a drug test . Pacquiao has a plaster applied after giving a blood sample to the examiner . Pacquiao was visited only four days after the packed red-carpet media event in LA which formally launched the build up to the $350million richest fight of all time. The inspector called at the house, where Pacquiao was relaxing with members of his team between work-outs with master trainer Freddie Roach at the fabled Wild Card Gym . The PacMan readily complied with tests for both blood – a process about which he had previously expressed his dislike – and urine. ‘No problem,’ he told the medic, with a smile. Earlier, his promoter Bob Arum had made it clear that Pacquiao had issued a $5m challenge to Mayweather with regard to the testing, and offered to surrender that amount should he fail the examination. In addition to the giving blood, Pacquiao also gave a urine sample during the test . Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather can expected to be randomly tested before the bout on May 2 in Las Vegas . Arum explained: ‘Manny proposed that if either of them did not pass a test, that man should pay the other $5m. ‘Floyd’s team declined. Not because anybody here is afraid of the outcome but because they realised they could legally get a lot more if it happened. ‘Fine with Manny. If Floyd fails we will be looking for much more compensation than $5m.' Pacquiao has already been paid damages – reportedly in seven figures – after taking legal action for remarks made by members of the Mayweather team, when they began demanding drugs-testing, which inferred that he might have used performance enhancing drugs in the past. Under the US procedures, which comply with the World Anti-Doping Agency standards applied for the Olympics, both boxers must submit to random testing in the weeks leading up to the fight and to another immediately after the event. Pacquiao was happy to be filmed by a camera crew from the Philippines, who are documenting the build up . Pacquiao proposed that if either boxer failed a drug test they would have to pay the other $5million . Pacquiao has had to overcome an element of paranoia that a loss of blood prior to fights might weaken him in the ring. But he is so cool about testing now that he allowed video-taping of Sunday’s test by a Philippines camera crew which is filming virtually his every move between now and fight night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Mayweather has campaigned vociferously in the last two years for the implementation of random blood testing for all fights. However, with a split purse of up to $180m for Mayweather and $120m for Pacquiao at stake, it seems inconceivable that either man would even remotely risk detection. Pacquiao has been documenting his training , seen here going fr a road run on the streets of LA . Mayweather hits the speed bag as his training camp continues in his Las Vegas gym . Mayweather vs Pacquiao is widely considered to be one of the biggest boxing fights of all-time . VIDEO Mayweather and Pacquiao camps exchange verbal blows . Not all boxers make hundreds of millions of dollars for risking their lives in the ring. Compared with the most lucrative pickings ever which await Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2, our own Michael Watson was on a modest stipend when he climbed through the ropes to fight Chris Eubank. That London evening in 1991 ended with Watson suffering crippling brain damage. It is nothing short of a miracle, made possible by rapid and brilliant medical intervention, that Watson has survived to celebrate his 50th birthday, let alone along the way complete a London Marathon in six days with the ever-supportive Eubank for company. Michael Watson (centre), pictured fighting Chris Eubank in 1991, turned 50 on Sunday . The bout left Watson with crippling brain damage and there will be a fund-raining dinner to celebrate his 50th . To celebrate Watson’s half-century, which he turned on Sunday, a fund-raising dinner will be held in London next month to help pay for the constant care he needs.

191,"Ten former Atlanta public school educators, convicted earlier this month of racketeering in one of the largest U.S. test-cheating scandals, were told to consider plea deals or face significantly more time behind bars. Fulton County Judge Jerry Baxter urged the defendants during the  sentencing hearing on Monday to accept deals with the prosecution in the trial over a widespread conspiracy to cheat on state tests. He also threatened prison sentences for them if they fail to reach those deals. 'I've got a fair sentence in my mind and it involves going to jail for everybody,' said Baxter. He also said, 'I don't think you want to go my way. Either it's my way or a negotiated plea.' The sentencing will resume on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter presides over the sentencing of 10 of the 11 defendants convicted of racketeering and other charges in the Atlanta Public Schools test-cheating trial in court on Monday . Former Atlanta public school educators fill the courtroom during the sentencing hearing which began on Monday . Former Atlanta public school Dunbar Elementary teacher Pamela Cleveland reacts in court as she listens to her mother testify on her behalf during witness statements during the sentencing . Reverend Bernice King (left), daughter of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr and Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young were both present in court on Monday . If the convicted educators accept deals, they would be required to apologize and waive their right to appeal, and former administrators would be given punishments from one year of weekend jail time and a $10,000 fine, according to the AJC. Former teachers and testing coordinators would be given one year of home confinement and a $1,000 fine. During a trial lasting nearly six months, prosecutors accused the defendants of erasing incorrect answers or instructing students to change their answers so the educators could secure promotions and cash bonuses in the 50,000-student Atlanta school system in 2009. The educators fed answers to students or erased and changed the answers on tests after they were turned in to secure promotions or up to $5,000 each in bonuses. However, the person accused of benefiting the most from the conspiracy, Superintendent Beverly Hall - who is thought to have received up to $500,000 in bonus payouts - died of breast cancer over the course of the trial. A total of 35 Atlanta educators were indicted in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, making false statements and theft. Many pleaded guilty before the trial, and some of them testified at the months-long trial. The jury acquitted one of the 12 former educators who had been on trial and convicted the other 11 on a racketeering charge, and were facing up to 20 years in prison. They were all found guilty under the the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, which is typically reserved for major mobsters and organized crime bosses. On Monday during the sentencing, Baxter said any children who were promoted based on false test scores were the real victims, adding that can lead to students later dropping out of school because they cannot do the work, having been cheated out of the earlier education. Such children often end up in trouble with the law, he said. 'They are the most vulnerable children in our city, and they were short-changed,' Baxter said. 'They were passed on and now they're in the prison system.' Baxter heard from character witnesses for 10 of the 11 defendants convicted this month of racketeering for their roles in a scheme to inflate students' scores on standardized exams. The witnesses — mostly friends and relatives of the defendants — pleaded for mercy and described the former educators' passion for teaching and dedication to their students, which often extended to devoting their personal time and money to help. Former Dobbs Elementary teacher Dessa Curb sat in court during sentencing. She was acquitted of all charges by the jury . Brian Evans, husband of former Atlanta public school Dobbs Elementary principal Dana Evans and former Atlanta public school testing coordinator Theresia Copeland become emotional in court . Former Atlanta Public School Dobbs Elementary principal Dana Evans asks for leniency during sentencing of racketeering charges in one of the largest U.S. test-cheating scandals during the sentencing . The 11th former educator who was convicted was pregnant when the jury reached its verdict and gave birth over the weekend. She is set to be sentenced later. Baxter listened carefully, often asking questions, and said repeatedly that while he didn't doubt the former educators' commitment and teaching ability, he believed they had made bad decisions. Whenever a witness or defense attorney questioned the jury's verdict, the judge quickly made it clear that he had heard the evidence and agreed with the verdict. Baxter said he arrived at work Monday with what he believed to be a fair sentence in mind. However, District Attorney Paul Howard told him he had been speaking with defense attorneys over the weekend and that he believed the case could be resolved with negotiated pleas, eliminating the possibility of appeals that could stretch on for years. 'I just see all the pain in this room,' Baxter said. 'It's a tragedy for all of you — the defendants, your families, your friends.' The only reason he would send them to jail, he said, would be for retribution. Fulton County Senior Asst. DA Clint Rucker talks with another member of the prosecution team during witness statements for the defendants . Former U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young testifies during witness statements at the sentencing asking the judge for leniency arguing that the former educators have much to offer the community if they are spared prison . 'I just think the best thing for our community in this whole sordid mess is for Paul Howard to talk to each of you and enter pleas,' Baxter said before calling a late lunch break around 2pm. When the hearing resumed an hour later, Baxter said the court would recess until Tuesday morning to give defense attorneys time to discuss with the district attorney about possible deals. Howard said he wants to see the defendants accept responsibility. Bernice King, daughter of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, last week urged the judge to spare the 11 educators from prison. Former elementary school principal Dana Evans was one of only two former educators who addressed the judge herself on Monday. She apologized and appealed to his sense of compassion, and Baxter made it clear he had sympathy for her, saying, 'you were under so much pressure, so my heart goes out to you.' In 2008, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a series of articles that questioned the veracity of test scores across the Atlanta school school system, which has 50,000 students . The newspaper contended the scores were statistically improbable . Gov. Sonny Perdue subsequently launched an investigation, which concluded in June 2011 . Superintendent Beverly L. Hall was the alleged ringleader of the cheating scandal, but denied any involvement. She died of breast cancer last month . It found at least 44 schools were guilty of cheating, dating back to 2005 . Educators fed answers to students or erased and changed answers on tests after they were turned in . One principal wore gloves as she erased and changed the answers . Nearly 180 employees, including 38 principals, were accused of wrongdoing . The report said Superintendent Beverly L. Hall (right) had 'created a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation' that had permitted 'cheating — at all levels — to go unchecked for years' The cheating allowed educators to collect bonuses and improve the ailing reputation of the Atlanta school system, the investigation found . It allowed them to accept bonuses of up to $5,000 each, however Dr Hall is believed to have accepted up to $500,000 . In March 2013, Dr Hall and 34 educators were indicted by a grand jury on charges including racketeering, making false statements and theft . 21 of the educators plead guilty to reach plea agreements . They received between 250 and 1,000 hours of community service and must repay their bonuses . 12 educators chose to stand trial . The trail started in August 2014 . Dr Hall did not stand trial or accept a plea, claiming she was too sick . She died of breast cancer in March 2015 . Prosecutors said the 12 were looking out for themselves rather than their students . On Wednesday, only one of the 12 educators were acquitted . The 11 educators - teachers, a principal and other administrators - were found guilty . The racketeering charges carry up to 20 years in prison . Source: AP, The New York Times . 'I know you want to hear an admission of guilt, but I can't do that because it's not true,' Evans told the judge, but added that she could say she is sorry. One defense attorney called former Atlanta mayor and United Nations ambassador Andrew Young to testify. Young said he had no connection to any of the defendants, but that his family includes many teachers. 'We have messed up education so much. Tests and grades do not make you educated,' he said on Monday, later adding, 'I think these teachers got caught in a trap.' Young asked Baxter for leniency, saying educators are 'the backbone of this society' and arguing that the former educators have much to offer the community if they are spared prison. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools, with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation. The cheating is believed to date back to 2001, when scores on statewide skills tests began to turn around in the 50,000-student school district. Between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered and falsely certified, according to the 2013 indictment. On Monday, Larry Pratt (above holding a memorial program for former superintendent Beverly Hall) protesters stood outside of the Fulton County courthouse with others during a protest to free the 11 educators . Protesters chant outside the Fulton County courthouse on Monday during the sentencing hearing of the convicted former educators . According to Governing.com, most educators' bonuses didn't exceed a total of $5,000 between 2005 and 2009. The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years. It only came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2008 that some test scores were statistically improbable. Howard the case was the biggest and most complex his office had ever handled lasting nearly two years and involved hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students.","Fulton County Judge Jerry Baxter urged defendants to accept sentencing deals on Monday or face significantly more time behind bars .

199,"Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola blamed his team's Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat by Porto on injuries. Porto take a two-goal advantage to Munich next Tuesday for the return leg of the last-eight clash after punishing a sloppy Bayern with two early goals from Ricardo Quaresma and a second-half effort from Jackson Martinez. Guardiola said: 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries ... their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Pep Guardiola says his side suffered with the injuries they are currently contending with in the squad . Porto manager Julen Lopetegui said his side can now dream of reaching the semi-finals, but they will need to be 'perfect' in the second leg. 'Now we have produced a situation for ourselves where we can dream, knowing that we will need to give everything we have got to get through,' Lopetegui, a former Barcelona team mate of Guardiola, told reporters. 'We will need to produce a perfect performance in Germany next week to progress.' Julen Lopetegui says reaching the Champions League semi-final would be a dream come true . Ricardo Quaresma (7) gave Porto an early lead from the spot but Manuel Neuer was lucky to be on the pitch . Lopetegui said the return from injury of goalscorer Martinez, who had been out since early March with a hamstring problem, was one of the reasons for Wednesday's victory. 'With him back in the attack, we were able to press Bayern with some force and give them real problems,' he said. Martinez, who capitalised on an error by Jerome Boateng in the 65th minute to round Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer for Porto's third goal after Thiago Alcantara had reduced the arrears, said he was not yet 100 percent fit. The striker was a constant menace for Bayern's defenders and his tenacious harrying was rewarded after three minutes when he robbed Xabi Alonso before being brought down by Neuer for a penalty that Quaresma converted. Jackson Martinez (right) rounds Neuer to slot home Porto's third goal and put them in control . Martinez troubled Bayern throughout and tackled Xabi Alonso (right) in the build up to the penalty . It was a similar story for Porto's second goal when Quaresma picked the pocket of Dante before beating Neuer with a clever finish on 10 minutes. 'It was fundamental that we tried our best to impose ourselves on Bayern and not give them a chance to settle,' Martinez said. Quaresma also sought to heap praise on Porto's team ethic, saying hard work had proved the difference between the two teams. 'There are no stars here. We all work hard for our results,' the forward said. 'The win is more important to us than the display. We have all worked extremely hard to get this win to give ourselves something to defend in the second leg.' Quaresma scores Porto's second inside 11 minutes as they took advantage of a depleted Bayern Munich .","Pep Guardiola blamed injuries for his side's disappointing defeat to Porto .
